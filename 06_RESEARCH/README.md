# Research

Working notes, source digestion, and analysis that inform future doctrine.

## Authority
- Non-authoritative scratch space; content remains provisional until promoted.
- Findings must be validated before influencing doctrine or playbooks.

## Usage
- Capture references and citations for all sources consulted.
- Summarize insights clearly so they can be triaged into `01_DOCTRINE` or `02_PLAYBOOKS`.
- Keep drafts dated to track research currency.

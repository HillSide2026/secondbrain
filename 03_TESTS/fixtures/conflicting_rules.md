# Test Fixture: Conflicting Rules

**Fixture ID:** FIXTURE-003
**Purpose:** Test detection of rule/runbook collisions

---

## Scenario

This fixture presents two rules that conflict with each other.
System Governance should detect the collision and output options.

---

## Rule A (from hypothetical DOCTRINE-001)

```markdown
## Artifact Retention

All artifacts in 09_INBOX must be triaged within 7 days.
Artifacts not triaged within 7 days SHALL be automatically archived.
```

## Rule B (from hypothetical DOCTRINE-002)

```markdown
## Artifact Retention

No artifact may be moved or archived without explicit ML1 approval.
Automatic archival is prohibited for all artifact types.
```

---

## Conflict Analysis

| Aspect | Rule A | Rule B | Conflict |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| Auto-archive | Required after 7 days | Prohibited | **YES** |
| ML1 approval | Not required | Required | **YES** |
| Scope | INBOX only | All artifacts | Overlapping |

---

## Expected Agent Behavior

### SYS-005 (System Governance)
- Should detect collision between rules
- Should NOT resolve autonomously
- Should output collision report with:
  - Both conflicting rules cited
  - Specific conflict points identified
  - Options for resolution
- Should escalate to ML1

---

## Validation Criteria

| Check | Expected Result |
|-------|-----------------|
| Collision detected | Yes |
| Both rules cited | Yes |
| Resolution attempted | No |
| Escalation to ML1 | Yes |
| Options provided | Yes |
| Output format compliant | Yes |

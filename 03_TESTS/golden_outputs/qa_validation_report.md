     title: [Playbook Title]
     status: draft
     author: [Author]
     last_updated: [Date]
     ---
     ```

2. **wrong_folder_doc.md**: Flag for governance review
   - Content appears to be doctrine
   - Placement decision required from SYS-005

---

## Actions

- [ ] Remediate frontmatter in new_playbook.md
- [ ] Handoff wrong_folder_doc.md to SYS-005 for placement review
- [ ] Re-validate after remediation

---

## Evidence

- 03_TESTS/fixtures/pr_changeset/new_playbook.md:1 — File starts with `# New Playbook` (no `---` block)
- 03_TESTS/fixtures/pr_changeset/modified_runbook.md:1-6 — Valid YAML frontmatter
- 03_TESTS/fixtures/pr_changeset/wrong_folder_doc.md:1 — Contains "Binding Policy" header
- 00_SYSTEM/SCHEMAS.md — Schema reference (if exists)

---

## Assumptions / Confidence

- Schema validation based on expected frontmatter format
- Content type inference based on keywords ("BINDING", "Policy")
- High confidence on frontmatter detection
- Medium confidence on content type classification

# Inbox

Temporary capture area for items awaiting triage or promotion.

## Authority
- Non-authoritative holding space; contents should not guide decisions.
- Items expire quickly and must be promoted, archived, or discarded.

## Usage
- Record enough context for later triage into `06_RESEARCH`, `07_REFERENCE`, or higher-authority folders.
- Clear items regularly to avoid stale material lingering here.
- Do not cite inbox contents as sources in doctrine or playbooks.

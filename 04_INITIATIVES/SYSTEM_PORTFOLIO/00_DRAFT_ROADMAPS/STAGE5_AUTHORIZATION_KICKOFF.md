# Stage 5 — Authorization & Kickoff (Delegated Execution)

## Status
- **Status:** DRAFT — NOT AUTHORIZED
- **Owner:** ML1
- **Effective Start:** TBD (after Stage 4 closure)
- **Authority Gate:** Explicit ML1 approval of delegated workflow list + boundaries

---

## Purpose
Stage 5 authorizes **delegated execution**: ML2 can execute repeatable work on ML1’s behalf **without making new judgments**.

**Core intent:** “Do exactly what I’ve already approved — faster, more consistently, and with an audit trail.”

---

## What Stage 5 Is

Stage 5 is **guardrailed autonomy** with zero new judgment:

- Doctrine already exists (playbooks, policies, templates)
- Decision boundaries are explicit
- Outputs are deterministic given inputs
- Human judgment is upstream, not embedded mid-process

### What ML2 Can Do
- Generate drafts
- Populate templates
- Run checklists
- Enforce constraints
- Flag violations
- Execute multi-step workflows

### What ML2 Cannot Do
- Decide *what* to do
- Invent new rules
- Resolve ambiguity

**If ambiguity exists → execution halts and escalates to ML1.**

---

## Preconditions
- Stage 4 closure approved (operating rhythm, audit checklist, promotion criteria)
- Binding doctrine, playbooks, and templates exist for each delegated workflow
- Audit/rollback expectations defined for each workflow

---

## Authorized Scope (Stage 5)
Stage 5 is authorized to execute **only** workflows that meet all of the following:

- Documented in approved playbooks/policies/templates
- Deterministic inputs → deterministic outputs
- Explicit boundaries and refusal conditions
- Audit trail requirements defined
- Escalation path defined for ambiguity

**No workflow is authorized until explicitly listed by ML1.**

---

## Not Authorized (Stage 5)
- Any workflow lacking approved doctrine or templates
- Any execution requiring new judgment or interpretation
- Any silent handling of ambiguity
- Any external write-back not explicitly authorized in a stage-specific approval
- Any autonomy that bypasses ML1 decision gates

---

## Binding Inputs (Stage 5 must use these)
- Approved playbooks, policies, and templates (specifics TBD per workflow)
- `00_SYSTEM/WRITE_BACK_POLICY.md`
- `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS/ROADMAP-SYSTEM-2026W05.md`

---

## Stage 5 Definition of Done (DoD)
- ML1 approves a concrete list of delegated workflows
- Each workflow has:
  - Approved doctrine/template inputs
  - Deterministic execution definition
  - Refusal conditions + escalation triggers
  - Audit logging + rollback plan
- SYS-005 governance PASS for Stage 5 authorization package
- SYS-009 QA PASS for workflow test outputs

---

## Workstreams
- **Workstream A:** Workflow inventory + prioritization
- **Workstream B:** Boundary definitions + refusal conditions
- **Workstream C:** Audit + rollback design
- **Workstream D:** Test harness + validation outputs

---

## ML1 Decisions Required
- Which workflows are delegated at Stage 5 (explicit list)
- Draft storage location and labeling requirements
- Any permitted external write-back (if any) and approval model
- Escalation threshold definitions

---

## Examples (Abstract)
- “Produce this report using Template v3.2”
- “Run the post-trade audit checklist on today’s trades”
- “Generate the compliance packet using approved doctrine”

**All leverage, no authority.**

# DRAFT Roadmaps (System Portfolio)

## Purpose
Exploratory roadmaps for system work. Draft roadmaps may contain competing options
and incomplete plans. They are planning artifacts only.

## Rules
- Draft roadmaps do not authorize execution by themselves.
- Multiple draft roadmaps may exist simultaneously.
- Roadmaps live under SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO only; do not create parallel Draft/Active
  folders elsewhere in the repo.

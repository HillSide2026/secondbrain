# Stage 2 — Read-Only Integration Foundation (Draft)

## Status
- Status: DRAFT
- Owner: ML1
- Precondition: Stage 1 completed
- Stage 1 completion artifact: `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS/STAGE1_INVENTORY.md`
- Kickoff date: 2026-01-25 (set by ML1)
- Review cadence: daily (ML1 review)

## Purpose
Stage 2 defines, bounds, and validates read-only integration specifications for Gmail, SharePoint, and Microsoft Word, ensuring access scopes, audit expectations, and comparison criteria are documented without execution, credentialed access, or write-back capabilities.

## In-Scope
- Gmail (read-only)
- SharePoint (read-only)
- Microsoft Word (read-only)
- Specification, comparison, and audit expectations only

## Out of Scope
- Any write-back or mutation
- Any automation or scheduled pulls
- Any matter-level data or workflows
- Credential storage or live system connection
- Doctrine or governance changes

## Integration Lifecycle Boundaries
- Permitted lifecycle stages: capture and triage definition only (specification-level artifacts).
- Prohibited lifecycle stages: promotion, execution, automation, monitoring, remediation, or any operational run state.

## Stage 2 Definition of Done (DoD)
- Read-only specifications completed for Gmail, SharePoint, and Microsoft Word.
- Permission scopes documented for each integration (read-only, no write-capability paths).
- Audit/logging expectations documented for each integration.
- Cross-integration comparison matrix completed (API/connector/export options and constraints).
- No write-capability paths identified in any spec or comparison artifact.
- Each read-only spec includes: Scope, Non-scope, Permissions assumptions, Audit/logging, Data objects/fields, Constraints, Open questions.
- Validation method confirmed: documentation-based validation and/or admin confirmation (no live credentials).

## Backlog (Stage 2)

### Gmail read-only specification
- **Description:** Define Gmail read-only scope, accessible data fields, retention expectations, and non-mutating extraction boundaries, using the required spec sections (Scope, Non-scope, Permissions assumptions, Audit/logging, Data objects/fields, Constraints, Open questions).
- **Dependencies:** Stage 1 completion package; documented guardrails.
- **Risks:** API limits, mailbox scope ambiguity, policy constraints.
- **Owner:** Integration Steward Agent.

### SharePoint read-only specification
- **Description:** Define SharePoint site/library scope, metadata fields, search behaviors, and read-only access boundaries, using the required spec sections (Scope, Non-scope, Permissions assumptions, Audit/logging, Data objects/fields, Constraints, Open questions).
- **Dependencies:** Stage 1 completion package; documented guardrails.
- **Risks:** Permissions complexity, tenant constraints, metadata inconsistencies.
- **Owner:** Integration Steward Agent.

### Microsoft Word read-only specification
- **Description:** Define Word document access patterns, file format handling, and extraction boundaries without mutation, using the required spec sections (Scope, Non-scope, Permissions assumptions, Audit/logging, Data objects/fields, Constraints, Open questions).
- **Dependencies:** Stage 1 completion package; documented guardrails.
- **Risks:** File format variability, access boundary ambiguity.
- **Owner:** Integration Steward Agent.

### Cross-integration comparison matrix
- **Description:** Compare read-only approaches (API, connector, export) across Gmail, SharePoint, and Word with scope and audit tradeoffs.
- **Dependencies:** Completed read-only specs for all three systems.
- **Risks:** Incomplete information, inconsistent assumptions between specs.
- **Owner:** Integration Steward Agent.

### Audit + logging expectations
- **Description:** Define audit/logging expectations for read-only access (access logs, retention, review cadence).
- **Dependencies:** Stage 1 completion package; read-only scope definitions.
- **Risks:** Ambiguous compliance requirements; insufficient audit detail.
- **Owner:** System Governance Agent.

### Spec completeness checklist
- **Description:** Verify each integration spec includes the required sections and completion criteria.
- **Dependencies:** Draft read-only specs for Gmail, SharePoint, and Word.
- **Risks:** Incomplete or inconsistent sections across specs.
- **Owner:** Runbook & QA Agent.

### No write-capability paths review
- **Description:** Review all specs and comparison matrix to confirm no write or mutation paths are implied.
- **Dependencies:** Draft read-only specs and comparison matrix.
- **Risks:** Implicit write or mutation assumptions left unchallenged.
- **Owner:** System Governance Agent.

## Agent Responsibilities (Stage 2)
- **Integration Steward Agent:** Owns the Gmail, SharePoint, and Word read-only specifications and the cross-integration comparison matrix.
- **System Governance Agent:** Owns audit/logging expectations and verifies read-only boundaries.
- **Runbook & QA Agent:** Validates specification completeness and alignment with non-authorizing constraints.
- **Authority constraint:** “No agent approves, promotes, or modifies doctrine.”

## Deliverables

- `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2_SHAREPOINT_READ_ONLY_SPEC.md`
- `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2_WORD_READ_ONLY_SPEC.md`
- `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2_INTEGRATION_COMPARISON_MATRIX.md`
- `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2_AUDIT_LOGGING_EXPECTATIONS.md`
- `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2_SPEC_COMPLETENESS_CHECKLIST.md`
- `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2_NO_WRITE_PATHS_REVIEW.md`

## Risks & Dependencies
- Permission scope clarity (tenant approvals may be required to confirm read-only boundaries).
- API limits and export constraints may restrict feasible read-only approaches.
- Ambiguity in metadata retention or audit log requirements could delay spec completion.
- Dependency on Stage 1 artifacts for guardrails and role context.

## Stage 2 Closure Criteria
- All three read-only specs completed and reviewed for non-mutating scope.
- Audit/logging expectations documented and mapped to each integration.
- Comparison matrix completed with explicit constraints and assumptions.
- Validation checklist confirms no write-capability paths or execution language.

## Roadmap Activation Criteria (Draft → Active)
- ML1 sign-off recorded (owner acceptance is sufficient).
- Stage 1 completion artifact linked and verified: `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS/STAGE1_INVENTORY.md`.
- Kickoff date and review cadence confirmed by ML1.
- Validation method documented as documentation-based and/or admin confirmation only (no live credentials).

## Decision Questions for ML1
- Which read-only integration approach should be prioritized per system (API vs connector vs export)?
- Are the documented read-only boundaries sufficient for Stage 3 sequencing?
- What evidence is required to confirm read-only scope without live credentials?
- Should any integration be deferred due to tenant/API constraints before Stage 3 planning?

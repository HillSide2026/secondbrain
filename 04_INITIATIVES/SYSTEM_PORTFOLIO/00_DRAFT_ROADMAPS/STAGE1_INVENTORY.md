# Stage 1 — System Discovery & Readiness Baseline (Consolidated)

## STAGE1_INVENTORY

**System-level inventory summary (what exists / where it lives):**
- **00_SYSTEM (governance docs):** Core governance artifacts present (README, glossary, schemas, decision log, system identity) plus an architecture subfolder containing an integration plan draft and a Stage 1 architecture map. Key files live directly under `00_SYSTEM/` with two items under `00_SYSTEM/architecture/`.
- **01_DOCTRINE (taxonomy + key docs):** Doctrine root contains README plus three doctrine tiers (`01_BINDING`, `02_INTERPRETIVE`, `03_PROCEDURAL`) and three doctrine docs at the root.
- **02_PLAYBOOKS / 03_TEMPLATES:** Both folders exist with READMEs only.
- **04_INITIATIVES (SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO structure):** `SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO` includes `00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS/` (draft roadmap + README) and `01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/` (README). `LL_PORTFOLIO` exists but is out of scope for system-level Stage 1 inventory.
- **06_RUNS:** Folder exists but contains no files.
- **Other top-level folders (per folder map):** `05_MATTERS` exists but contains no files; `07_RESEARCH`, `08_REFERENCE`, `09_INBOX`, `10_ARCHIVE` each contain a README only.

**Index of key files (repo-relative paths):**

## STAGE1_GAPS_OPPORTUNITIES

1) **Gap:** System-level agent roster (target 5 roles) is not yet defined as artifacts.  
   **Why it matters:** Stage 3 requires defined roles and handoffs; without the roster, downstream orchestration and governance work cannot start.  
   **Suggested owner:** ML1.

2) **Gap:** Read-only integration specs (Gmail, SharePoint, Word) are missing.  
   **Why it matters:** Stage 2 DoD depends on documented scopes and audit expectations; absence blocks integration planning and sequencing.  
   **Suggested owner:** Agent (Integration Steward Agent).

3) **Gap:** Governance guardrails for Stage 2/3 (no matters, no doctrine edits, logging expectations) are not yet consolidated into a dedicated artifact.  
   **Why it matters:** Guardrails reduce risk of scope creep and non-compliant integrations; they are also a prerequisite for safe agent and integration work.  
   **Suggested owner:** Agent (System Governance Agent) — **Unassigned (Blocked)** until the role is formalized.

## STAGE1_RISKS_DEPENDENCENCIES

- **Risk/Dependency:** Access to Gmail/SharePoint/Word may require tenant approvals or admin credentials.  
  **Impact:** Stage 2 read-only specs could stall without confirmed access models.  
  **Mitigation/Next action:** Confirm credential/permission path with ML1 and log required scopes early.

- **Risk/Dependency:** Unclear audit/logging requirements for read-only integrations.  
  **Impact:** Integration design may fail compliance expectations or need rework.  
  **Mitigation/Next action:** Define minimal logging + retention expectations before drafting integration specs.

- **Risk/Dependency:** API limits or tenant restrictions (rate limits, export constraints).  
  **Impact:** Integration approach comparisons may be invalid or infeasible.  
  **Mitigation/Next action:** Include limits check as part of Stage 2 requirements gathering.

- **Risk/Dependency:** Ambiguity in definitions (e.g., “active agent,” “read-only integration”).  
  **Impact:** Stage 3 agent roster and Stage 2 integration scope may drift or conflict with doctrine.  
  **Mitigation/Next action:** Add concise definitions in a governance artifact before Stage 2/3 work.

- **Risk/Dependency:** Sequencing dependency between integration specs and agent role design.  
  **Impact:** Agent roles may be defined without understanding data access constraints.  
  **Mitigation/Next action:** Establish a joint sequencing note: Stage 2 integration scopes inform Stage 3 agent responsibilities.

## NEXT_STEPS

1) **Integrations:** Draft read-only requirements for Gmail, SharePoint, and Word (scopes, audit expectations, boundaries).  
2) **Agents:** Define the 5 system-level agent roles with responsibilities and handoff inputs/outputs.  
3) **Governance:** Draft a guardrails artifact covering “no matters,” “no doctrine edits,” and audit/logging expectations.

## STAGE1_CLOSURE_RECOMMENDATION

**Stage 1 DoD checklist (from roadmap):**
- **System inventory completed for core governance + portfolio structure.** — **PASS** (this consolidated inventory section; see STAGE1_INVENTORY).
- **Gaps/opportunities list created for system-level agents and read-only integrations.** — **PASS** (see STAGE1_GAPS_OPPORTUNITIES).
- **Draft architecture map for integrations and agent roles documented.** — **PASS** (`00_SYSTEM/architecture/ARCH-2026-01X-stage1-architecture-map.md`).
- **Risks and dependencies logged for downstream stages.** — **PASS** (see STAGE1_RISKS_DEPENDENCENCIES).

**Minimum missing items to close Stage 1:** None.

**Stage 1 can be closed: YES**

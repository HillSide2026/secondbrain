**Artifacts:** `10_ARCHIVE/INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/STAGE1/STAGE1.2/`

### 1.3 System-Level Agent Orchestration ✅
**DoD:**
- 5 system-level agent roles defined with responsibilities + handoffs
- Agent governance guardrails documented
- Runbooks scoped for agent execution flows
- Metrics for reliability + throughput defined

**Artifacts:** `01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/STAGE1/STAGE1.3/` (ready for archive)

### 1.4 Portfolio Operating Rhythm ✅
**DoD:**

## Stage 2 — Implementation & Operations 🔄 ACTIVE

**Purpose:** Build and deploy actual agents and integrations; validate operational readiness.
**Status:** Kickoff approved. Sub-stages in progress.

### 2.1 Agent Runtime Setup 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**DoD:**
- Agent runtime selected and configured: **Claude Code agents**
- Credential storage configured: **Environment variables** (`.env` excluded from git)
- All 5 agents deployed and tested against runbooks

**Decisions Resolved:**
- Runtime: Claude Code agents (subprocess model)
- Credentials: Environment variables (upgrade to secrets manager later if needed)

**Backlog Items:** SYS-001, SYS-005 to SYS-009

### 2.2 Integration Activation 📋 PLANNED
**DoD:**
- Gmail read-only integration active with audit logging
- SharePoint read-only integration active with audit logging
- Word/OneDrive read-only integration active with audit logging
- No-write-path verification completed for all

**Sequence:** Gmail → SharePoint → Word (per ML1 decision)

**Backlog Items:** SYS-002, SYS-003, SYS-004

### 2.3 Operational Validation 📋 PLANNED
**DoD:**
- First full operating cycle completed (weekly cadence)
- All agents produce at least one artifact per runbook
- Metrics baseline established
- System declared operational for steady-state use

**Backlog Items:** SYS-010, SYS-011, metrics baseline, rhythm adjustment

### 2.9 Drive Integration Setup 🟨 BACKLOG
**DoD:**
- Drive access limited to approved folder boundary
- Read/write test passes inside boundary; fails outside
- Auth model + scopes documented

**Artifacts:** `01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2.9/`

### 2.10 Authoritative Ledger in Drive 🟨 BACKLOG
**DoD:**
- Ledger persists in Drive and survives daily regeneration
- Human status edits respected
- Daily report is ledger-first

**Artifacts:** `01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2.10/`

### 2.11 Matter Management Agent 🟨 BACKLOG
**DoD:**
- Hourly Matter Dashboard runs (9–5, Mon–Fri)
- Repo-local outputs only (no write-back)
- Governance validation passes

**Artifacts:** `01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2.11/`

### 2.12 Calendar Scheduling 🟨 BACKLOG

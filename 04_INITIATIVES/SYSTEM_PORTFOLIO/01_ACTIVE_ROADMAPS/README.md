# ACTIVE Roadmaps (System Portfolio)

## Purpose
The currently selected system roadmap(s) explicitly chosen by ML1 for sequencing
and prioritizing System Portfolio initiatives.

## Rules
- Active roadmaps guide prioritization and sequencing; they do not create doctrine
  or modify system rules by themselves.
- Maintain at most one active roadmap per scope; superseded roadmaps move back
  to Draft or into Archive with a clear note.
- Roadmaps live under SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO only; do not create parallel Draft/Active
  folders elsewhere in the repo.

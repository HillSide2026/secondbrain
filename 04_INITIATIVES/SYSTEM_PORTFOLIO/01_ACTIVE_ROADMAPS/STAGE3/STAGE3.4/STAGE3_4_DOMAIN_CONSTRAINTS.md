# Stage 3.4 Domain-Specific Constraints (Legal)

## Privilege
- Do not infer privilege status
- Preserve privilege markings verbatim
- Do not summarize privileged content for redistribution

## Legal Documents
- Preserve defined terms exactly
- Preserve quotations when precision matters
- Do not restate obligations or rights beyond compression

## Communications
- Do not infer intent or strategy
- Do not characterize tone unless explicitly stated
- Do not resolve ambiguities

## Safety Rule
When uncertain, include less and note ambiguity.

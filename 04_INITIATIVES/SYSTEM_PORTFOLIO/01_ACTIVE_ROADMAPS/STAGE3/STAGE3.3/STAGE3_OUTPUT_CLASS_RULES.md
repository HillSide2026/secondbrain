# Stage 3 Output Class Rules — Stage 3.3

## One Invocation Rule
Each invocation may produce exactly one output class.

## No Mixing
Outlines, summaries, and coverage lists may not appear together.

## Formatting
- Bullet lists only
- No paragraphs
- No sub-analysis under bullets

## Violations
If outputs blend classes or introduce prose, usage must stop immediately.

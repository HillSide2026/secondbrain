# Stage 3.3 Scope Lock — Coverage & Brainstorm Lists

## Purpose
Stage 3.3 authorizes the system to generate list-based scaffolding to reduce omission risk.
All outputs are non-authoritative thinking aids.

## Authorized Output Classes
- Points to cover
- Questions to answer
- Risks to flag
- Follow-ups
- Likely misunderstandings

## Hard Constraints
- Lists only
- No prioritization
- No recommendations
- No conclusions
- No likelihood assessments
- No narrative framing

## Prohibited
- Prose paragraphs
- Judgments or advice
- "What you should do"
- "This is important"
- Any client-ready language

## Authority
Stage 3.3 outputs carry no authority and require full human rewrite.

If any output violates these constraints, Stage 3.3 must pause.

# System Portfolio Backlog

## Purpose
Centralized backlog for System Portfolio initiatives. Items here are candidates for
inclusion in active roadmaps but do not authorize execution by themselves.

## Backlog Rules
- Items must include: description, owner (or TBD), and dependencies (if any)
- Items are prioritized by ML1; agents may propose but not reorder
- Promoted items move to active roadmap stages; completed items are removed or archived
- Backlog does not create doctrine or authorize execution

## Priority Legend
- **P0**: Blocking — must resolve before other work proceeds
- **P1**: High — core functionality, schedule ASAP
- **P2**: Medium — important but not blocking
- **P3**: Low — nice to have, schedule when capacity allows

## Recently Completed (for reference)
- **Stage 1**: System Discovery & Readiness Baseline — archived
- **Stage 2**: Read-Only Integration Foundation — archived
- **Stage 3**: System-Level Agent Orchestration — READY_FOR_CLOSURE
- **Stage 4**: Portfolio Operating Rhythm — OUTSTANDING

## How to Add Items
1. Add a row to the Candidate Items table
2. Assign an ID (sequential: SYS-001, SYS-002, etc.)
3. Leave Status as `candidate` until promoted to a roadmap stage

# SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO

## Purpose
Initiatives whose primary purpose is to improve, extend, or harden the Second Brain system itself (architecture, governance, schemas, tooling, automation).

## Examples
- Folder contract and structure refactors
- Governance and change-control improvements
- Promotion workflows (INBOX → Doctrine/Playbooks/Templates)
- Tooling/automation enhancements
- Retrieval/RAG or agent integration work

## Boundary rule
Work here may propose changes to system governance, doctrine, playbooks, or templates, but nothing becomes binding until explicitly promoted and approved.

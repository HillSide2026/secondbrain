## SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO

**Purpose:** Initiatives that improve the Second Brain system itself (ML2).

**Beneficiary:** The system's ability to support ML1 and LL.

**Examples:**
- Agent runtime setup
- Integration activation
- Cognitive scaffolding development
- System governance improvements

**Governance:** Follows stage-based roadmap model with explicit authorization gates.

---

## LL_PORTFOLIO

**Purpose:** Initiatives whose primary purpose is to improve how Levine Law (LL) operates.

**Beneficiary:** Levine Law as an operating firm.

**Core Principle:**
> ML1 defines intent and priority. ML2 preserves scope, constraints, and state. LL consumes ONLY ML1-approved outputs, never raw reasoning.

**Governance:** Follows controlled registry model with explicit ML2 function authorization.

See: `LL_PORTFOLIO/README.md` for detailed governance rules.

## Boundary Rules

### SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO → LL_PORTFOLIO

- System capabilities may enable LL capabilities
- System outputs may be consumed by LL workflows
- System doctrine applies to LL operations

### LL_PORTFOLIO → SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO

- LL requirements may drive system priorities
- LL feedback may trigger system improvements
- LL operations never modify system governance

# LL Delivery System

## Purpose
Define and govern the firm-wide delivery relationship between LL, clients, and the legal system.

## Scope
This system governs engagement framing, role clarity, scope boundaries, escalation logic, and artifact classification.

## What This System Owns
- Engagement-level scope definition
- Advisory vs operational role boundaries
- Escalation triggers and stop conditions
- Internal vs external artifact classification

## What This System Does NOT Own
- Practice-area legal analysis
- Solution-specific work execution
- Matter administration or billing
- Marketing, Sales, or Fulfillment

## Interfaces With Other LL Systems
- LL Fulfillment System
- LL Marketing System
- LL Sales System
- LL Management System
- Practice Area Systems

## Open Design Questions
- When does delivery formally begin and end?
- What events require mandatory human escalation?
- How is delivery authority documented?

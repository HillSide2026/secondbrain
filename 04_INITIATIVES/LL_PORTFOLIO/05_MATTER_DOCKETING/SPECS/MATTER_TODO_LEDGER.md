# Matter To-Do Task Ledger Specification

**Status:** NORMATIVE
**Version:** 2.0
**Effective:** 2026-02-07

---

## 1. Purpose

The Task Ledger provides persistent, append-only memory for the Matter To-Do Report system. It prevents daily task regeneration from scratch by maintaining stable task identity and human-owned status across runs.

**Authority Level:** DERIVED / ADVISORY

The ledger is non-authoritative. It is not a docket. It adds memory and state to the task extraction pipeline without adding obligation enforcement.

---

## 2. Design Principle

> Extraction is ephemeral. The ledger is persistent. The report is a view, not the memory.

The ledger exists to prevent temporal amnesia. Tasks that were observed on Day 1 must not vanish on Day 5 solely because they fell outside the email input window.

---

## 3. Ledger Artifact

### 3.1 File

The ledger MUST be maintained as a local, append-only artifact named:

- `MATTER_TODO_LEDGER.md` or
- `MATTER_TODO_LEDGER.json`

Format selection is implementation-dependent. The ledger is the system of record for task continuity.

### 3.2 Ledger Entry Fields

Each ledger entry MUST include:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `task_id` | string | YES | Stable identifier (see Section 4) |
| `matter_id` | string | YES | Associated matter ID or `UNASSIGNED` |
| `task` | string | YES | Verb-first task text |
| `status` | enum | YES | One of: NEW, TRIAGED, WAITING, DONE, DROPPED, STALE |
| `first_seen` | date | YES | Date the task was first extracted |
| `last_seen` | date | YES | Date the task was most recently observed in extraction |
| `suggested_workstream` | enum | YES | One of: DELIVERY, FULFILLMENT, MARKETING, MANAGEMENT, UNROUTED |
| `suggested_lane` | enum | YES | One of: LAWYER, NON_LAWYER, ADMIN_ACCOUNTS, INTAKE, UNROUTED |
| `routing_confidence` | enum | YES | One of: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW |
| `routing_reason` | string | YES | Short explanation anchored to evidence (quote-backed when possible) |
| `next_action_type` | enum | YES | One of: RESPOND, REVIEW, DRAFT, FILE_SUBMIT, SCHEDULE, PAY_INVOICE, SEND_REQUEST, UPDATE_LOG, OTHER |
| `evidence` | array | YES | Supporting evidence references (append-only) |

### 3.3 Append-Only Rule

Ledger entries MUST NOT be deleted automatically. Entries may only be removed by explicit human action.

---

## 4. Task Identity (Stable IDs)

### 4.1 Requirement

Each task MUST have a stable `task_id`. The same real-world task MUST always resolve to the same `task_id` regardless of which daily run observes it.

### 4.2 ID Generation

Default ID generation is a hash of:

```
hash(normalized_task_text + matter_id_or_UNASSIGNED + originating_message_ref)
```

If `message_ref` is unavailable, substitute:

```
hash(normalized_task_text + matter_id_or_UNASSIGNED + email_date + from + subject)
```

### 4.3 Normalization

Before hashing, task text MUST be normalized:

- Lowercased
- Whitespace collapsed
- Punctuation stripped

This ensures that minor formatting differences do not produce duplicate task IDs.

---

## 5. Ledger Status Model

### 5.1 Status Values

Ledger entries MUST use exactly one of the following statuses:

| Status | Meaning | Set By |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `NEW` | First observed, not yet reviewed | System (automatic on creation) |
| `TRIAGED` | Reviewed by a human, still pending | Human |
| `WAITING` | Blocked on external action | Human |
| `DONE` | Closed | Human |
| `DROPPED` | Explicitly marked "not a task" | Human |
| `STALE` | Unresolved and not re-seen past staleness threshold | System (automatic) |

### 5.2 Status Transition Rules

- The system MAY set status to `NEW` on task creation.
- The system MAY set status to `STALE` when the staleness threshold is exceeded.
- All other status transitions (`TRIAGED`, `WAITING`, `DONE`, `DROPPED`) are human-driven.
- The system MUST NOT auto-promote or auto-close tasks.

### 5.3 Staleness Threshold

A task becomes `STALE` when:

- Its status is `NEW` and `last_seen` exceeds the staleness threshold
- Default staleness threshold: 14 days since `last_seen`

Tasks with status `TRIAGED` or `WAITING` MUST NOT be automatically marked `STALE`.

---

## 6. Daily Run Behavior (Two-Phase)

Each daily run MUST perform both phases below.

### Phase 1 — Extract Candidates

1. Extract task candidates from today's inbound emails using the existing pipeline.
2. Apply all current classification, refusal, evidence, and attribution rules unchanged (per `MATTER_TODO_REPORT.md`).
3. Only emails classified as `ACTION_REQUIRED` may produce candidates.

Phase 1 is identical to the existing extraction pipeline. No changes.

### Phase 2 — Reconcile Against Ledger

For each extracted candidate:

**If it matches an existing ledger task:**
1. Reuse the existing `task_id`
2. Update `last_seen` to today's date
3. Append new evidence if materially different from existing evidence
4. Update routing fields (`suggested_workstream`, `suggested_lane`, `routing_confidence`, `routing_reason`, `next_action_type`) ONLY if new evidence materially changes routing; otherwise preserve prior routing to avoid churn

**If it does not match any existing task:**
1. Create a new ledger entry
2. Set `status` to `NEW`
3. Set `first_seen` and `last_seen` to today
4. Populate all routing fields (`suggested_workstream`, `suggested_lane`, `routing_confidence`, `routing_reason`, `next_action_type`)

**For ledger tasks not observed today:**
1. DO NOT delete them
2. Retain them in the ledger, including all routing fields
3. If `last_seen` exceeds the staleness threshold and status is `NEW`, set status to `STALE`

### 6.1 Match Criteria

A candidate matches an existing ledger task when their `task_id` values are identical (per the hash defined in Section 4).

---

## 7. Carry-Forward Rule

The daily Matter To-Do Report MUST include:

- All newly extracted tasks (status: `NEW`)
- All unresolved ledger tasks regardless of email window:
  - `NEW`
  - `TRIAGED`
  - `WAITING`
  - `STALE`

Tasks with status `DONE` or `DROPPED` MUST NOT appear in the report.

Tasks MUST NOT disappear from the report solely because they fall outside the email input window.

---

## 8. Sort Order

When the ledger is rendered (to report, spreadsheet, or any output view), entries MUST be sorted in the following order:

1. **Primary:** `suggested_workstream` — DELIVERY → FULFILLMENT → MARKETING → MANAGEMENT → UNROUTED
2. **Secondary:** `matter_id` — ascending alphanumeric within each workstream
3. **Tertiary:** `task_id` — ascending within each matter

DELIVERY always appears first. This ensures the highest-priority operational work is surfaced at the top of every view.

---

## 9. Non-Goals

The ledger MUST NOT:

- Be treated as a docket
- Invent deadlines or owners
- Auto-resolve tasks
- Delete tasks automatically
- Infer completion from silence
- Create or infer personal accountability
- Auto-assign internal staff
- Treat routing as authoritative staffing policy

# 06_FINANCIAL_PORTFOLIO — Models & Constraints

## Purpose

Financial visibility and modeling WITHOUT decision authority.

## Scope

**Characteristics:** Analytical, assumption-bound, advisory only

### In Scope

- Revenue and pricing frameworks
- Unit economics
- Cost models
- Scenario and sensitivity analysis
- Financial constraints (e.g., margin floors)

### Out of Scope

- Setting prices
- Approving discounts
- Declaring profitability
- Auto-feeding outputs into operations/sales
- Treating models as decisions

## Critical Boundary

- **Accounting = facts** (01_ACCOUNTING)
- **Financial Portfolio = models** (this folder)
- **They must never be mixed.**

## ML1 Authority Statement

ML1 is the sole authority for pricing decisions, discount approvals, and profitability declarations. ML2 may model scenarios but all outputs are advisory only.

## Explicit Prohibitions

ML2 must NOT:

- Set prices
- Approve discounts
- Declare profitability
- Auto-feed outputs into operations or sales systems
- Treat models as decisions
- Mix accounting facts with financial models
- Execute based on model outputs

## Approval State

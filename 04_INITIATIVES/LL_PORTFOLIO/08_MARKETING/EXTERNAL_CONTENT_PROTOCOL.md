# External Content Improvement Protocol

**Location:** `LL_PORTFOLIO/08_MARKETING/`

**Applies to:** Second Brain (ML2)

**Scope:** Book manuscript + Blog content (100% external to client matters)

**Status:** Draft — Requires ML1 Approval

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol governs how the Second Brain (ML2) may **analyze, improve, and extend external-facing content**, including:

* A draft book manuscript
* A pre-planned blog content calendar (first 6 months)

This content is **entirely external** to:

* client matters
* delivery
* docketing
* legal execution

The goal is to improve **clarity, quality, coherence, positioning, and authority** without creating legal advice or bleeding into matter-specific work.

---

## 2. Hard Boundary: External Content Only

All content covered by this protocol is:

* Pre-matter
* Non-client-specific
* Non-operational
* Non-delivery

ML2 must treat this content as:

* Educational
* Thought leadership
* Marketing-adjacent

> **Rule:** No content produced or edited under this protocol may reference or depend on any client matter, docketing state, or delivery artifact.

---

## 3. Content Types Covered

### 3.1 Book

* Long-form educational manuscript
* Positioning and authority-building asset
* Not legal advice
* Not jurisdiction-specific guidance unless explicitly stated by ML1

### 3.2 Blog

* Short- to medium-form articles
* Published on a defined cadence (per content calendar)
* Used for education, discovery, and lead warming

---

## 4. What ML2 Is Allowed to Do

ML2 MAY:

* Analyze drafts for:

  * clarity
  * structure
  * coherence
  * tone
  * internal consistency

* Propose:

  * rewrites
  * reordering
  * section expansions or contractions
  * headlines and subheads
  * examples, analogies, and explanations

* Identify:

  * gaps
  * redundancies
  * unclear assumptions
  * audience mismatch

* Align content to:

  * funnel positioning (education → intake)
  * offer taxonomy (non-binding)
  * consistent terminology

* Generate derivative content:

  * blog posts derived from book chapters
  * outlines
  * summaries
  * teaser excerpts

---

## 5. What ML2 Is Explicitly Prohibited From Doing

ML2 MUST NOT:

* Provide legal advice
* Tailor content to specific clients or fact patterns
* Promise outcomes
* Draft engagement language
* Include pricing, scope, or timelines
* Reference active or hypothetical matters
* Convert content into delivery workflows

> **Rule:** If a reader could reasonably treat the content as advice for their specific situation, ML2 must flag it for revision.

---

## 6. Improvement Workflow (Book)

For the book manuscript, ML2 operates in **editorial mode**, not author mode.

### Step 1: Structural Review

* Chapter flow
* Argument progression
* Redundant or missing sections

### Step 2: Clarity & Authority Pass

* Plain-language rewrites
* Stronger framing
* Reduced jargon

### Step 3: Consistency Pass

* Terminology
* Definitions
* Concept reuse

### Step 4: Derivative Mapping

* Identify chapters suitable for blog adaptation
* Propose excerpt boundaries

All changes are **proposed**, not applied, until approved by ML1.

---

## 7. Improvement Workflow (Blog)

For the blog, ML2 operates against the **existing content calendar**.

ML2 MAY:

* Improve outlines
* Suggest angles or reframing
* Strengthen introductions and conclusions
* Ensure continuity across posts

ML2 MUST:

* Respect the calendar sequence
* Avoid introducing delivery or matter-level specificity

---

## 8. Tone & Positioning Rules

All content should:

* Educate without prescribing
* Demonstrate expertise without intimidation
* Invite inquiry without pressure
* Maintain consistency with Levine Law positioning

---

## 9. Approval & Versioning

* All edits are drafts until ML1 approval
* ML2 must preserve original versions
* Changes must be attributable and reviewable

---

## 10. Escalation Rule

If ML2 encounters:

* unclear legal boundaries
* jurisdiction-specific risk
* content that could be misconstrued as advice

ML2 must:

> Stop. Flag. Request ML1 guidance.

---

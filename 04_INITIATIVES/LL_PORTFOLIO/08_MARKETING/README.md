# Marketing Portfolio

**Location:** `04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/08_MARKETING/`

**Status:** Draft — Requires ML1 Approval

---

## 1. Core Definition

The Marketing portfolio defines how potential work enters Levine Law **before a matter exists**.

Marketing governs:

* Visibility
* Lead capture
* Qualification
* Onboarding (closing)

Marketing does NOT govern:

* Legal delivery
* Docketing
* Billing or accounting
* Pricing decisions
* Capacity management

Once a matter is opened in Clio, responsibility transfers immediately and exclusively to:

> `04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/05_MATTER_DOCKETING/`

---

## 2. Authority & System Boundaries

**ML1** is the sole authority for:

* Qualification standards
* Acceptance or rejection of work
* Onboarding approval

**ML2** may:

* Observe
* Tag
* Track
* Suggest actions within Marketing stages

**ML2** must NOT:

* Accept or reject work autonomously
* Open matters in Clio
* Infer delivery priority or scope

**Clio** is the system of record once onboarding completes.

---

## 3. Marketing is Organized by Funnels

Marketing is organized into distinct **FUNNELS**.

Funnels must never be merged or inferred.

Each funnel contains exactly three stages:

1. Ads / Lead Capture
2. Intake (Qualification)
3. Onboarding (Closing)

---

## 4. Funnel Definitions

### Funnel 1: Toronto Corporate Lawyer

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Acquisition | Google Ads → Landing Page |
| Intake & Onboarding System | Go High Level (GHL) |

**Offers:**

| Offer |
|-------|
| Incorporation |
| Shareholder Agreement |
| Shareholder Change |

### Funnel 2: Payments / MSB / PSP

| Tier | Offer |
|------|-------|

---

## 5. Offer Rules (Global)

Offers are **marketing constructs only**.

Offers:

* Are used for qualification and routing
* Do NOT define delivery workflows
* Do NOT imply pricing, scope, or priority
* Do NOT auto-progress

### Classification Rules

* **"New Shareholder" is NOT a standalone offer.**
* All shareholder admissions fall under **"Shareholder Change"**.
* The value ladder (Launch → Grow → Scale → Exit) is a marketing classification only.
* Clients do NOT auto-advance between offers.

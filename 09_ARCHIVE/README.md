Historical record of deprecated or superseded artifacts.

## Authority
- Maintains historical context only; not an active source of guidance.
- Authoritative materials remain in `00_SYSTEM` and `01_DOCTRINE` with pointers here when replaced.

## Usage
- Move superseded items here with `status: deprecated` metadata and links to their replacements.
- Preserve provenance for audits and reference, avoiding deletions that erase history.
- Consult when tracing decision history or legacy workflows.

# Templates

Reusable document scaffolds derived from doctrine and playbooks.

## Authority
- Derived materials that reflect `00_SYSTEM` and `01_DOCTRINE`; they do not create new policy.
- Template guidance defers to doctrine or playbooks when conflicts arise.

## Usage
- Include YAML frontmatter per `00_SYSTEM/SCHEMAS.md` and cite source doctrine or playbooks.
- Keep placeholders clear so contributors can capture required metadata and steps.
- Refresh templates when underlying doctrine or workflows change.

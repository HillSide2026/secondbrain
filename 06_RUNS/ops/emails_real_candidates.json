Thank you again for your message, I really appreciate the transparency.\r\nI completely understand, and I’m very glad to hear that you’d like to find a way for us to work together.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to emphasize that I would be very happy to get started right away with whatever hours you have available initially. My main priority is the opportunity to begin working with you, learn the practice, and contribute as things ramp up.\r\n\r\nYour suggestion to touch base again in a couple of weeks makes perfect sense, and once the joint venture is finalized and workflow becomes clearer, we can certainly revisit what a more consistent weekly structure might look like at that time.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to mention that I’m currently in touch with a few individuals and business contacts who may be seeking legal support in the near term, and I would be very happy to explore opportunities to bring additional work into the firm as we get started.\r\n\r\nWhenever you have a moment, I’d be happy to connect briefly by phone, but I’m also very comfortable moving forward by email if easier.\r\n\r\nThank you again. I’m very excited about the possibility of working together.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nLaura Hinton",

Seems they want us to go much further on the two clauses marked as problematic as related to CSBFP program. I asked for exact clarity on what needs to come out and have pasted response below. I feel weird striking it myself without running through you. Can you please have a look, let me know if it makes sense (no choice, it seems), then strike as part of final redline. \r\n> I will then do my best to summarize all changes and share with LL. Fingers crossed, ugh. Stressful!\r\n> Thank you. Note from bank here:\r\n> \r\n> Good morning Chris,\r\n> \r\n> I hope you are well. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your continued support throughout this process.\r\n> \r\n> Regarding the lease, I wanted to discuss two specific clauses that present challenges for our agreement:\r\n> \r\n> - Section 3.4 – Leasehold Improvements: The clause states, \"All Leasehold Improvements shall immediately upon installation become the absolute property of the Landlord, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances.\" The following needs to be removed: the entire section 3.4 (a, b, c, d). We need to reference the property address in the General Security Agreement, and this clause prevents us from doing so.\r\n> \r\n> - Section 8.2 – No Financing by Tenant of Leasehold Improvements: The clause states, \"The Tenant shall not create any lien, mortgage, charge, conditional sale agreement or other encumbrance in respect of its Leasehold Improvements.\" Removing this clause would allow us to secure the leaseholds, which is necessary for our agreement.\r\n> \r\n> You are requesting financing on the leasehold improvements, but these clauses prevent you from doing so. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your attention to these matters. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know.

      "body": "Hi Matthew-\r\nAs mentioned, I sent lease to lender (TD) for final review before sharing with LL. Seems they want us to go much further on the two clauses marked as problematic as related to CSBFP program. I asked for exact clarity on what needs to come out and have pasted response below. I feel weird striking it myself without running through you. Can you please have a look, let me know if it makes sense (no choice, it seems), then strike as part of final redline. \r\nI will then do my best to summarize all changes and share with LL. Fingers crossed, ugh. Stressful!\r\nThank you. Note from bank here:\r\n\r\nGood morning Chris,\r\n\r\nI hope you are well. \r\n\r\nThank you for your continued support throughout this process.\r\n\r\nRegarding the lease, I wanted to discuss two specific clauses that present challenges for our agreement:\r\n\r\n- Section 3.4 – Leasehold Improvements: The clause states, \"All Leasehold Improvements shall immediately upon installation become the absolute property of the Landlord, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances.\" The following needs to be removed: the entire section 3.4 (a, b, c, d). We need to reference the property address in the General Security Agreement, and this clause prevents us from doing so.\r\n\r\n- Section 8.2 – No Financing by Tenant of Leasehold Improvements: The clause states, \"The Tenant shall not create any lien, mortgage, charge, conditional sale agreement or other encumbrance in respect of its Leasehold Improvements.\" Removing this clause would allow us to secure the leaseholds, which is necessary for our agreement.\r\n\r\nYou are requesting financing on the leasehold improvements, but these clauses prevent you from doing so. \r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to these matters. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know. I look forward to working together on this.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n \r\nTisanth Thanabalasingam\r\nRemote Account Manager, Small Business (Remote Strategy) | TD  Business Banking \r\n\r\n> On Jan 30, 2026, at 4:33 PM, Matthew Levine <matthew@levinelegal.ca> wrote:\r\n> \r\n> Hi Chris\r\n> \r\n> Attached is consolidated redline and clean copy.

If so, where are the contracts?\r\n\r\n3. Should you have the current employees sign new employment agreements? If so, what consideration should be offered (you have to give them something to get them to sign)? Keep in mind that even signing the new agreement doesn't mean they start a probationary period.\r\n\r\nFind out how long each of the employees has been there.

Subject to these Terms and Conditions, a promotional purchase interest rate of 9.99% will apply to new purchases (excludes any membership costs associated with optional credit card benefits and services, such as balance protection, roadside assistance, travel insurance, and similar offerings) on your account for 6 months, from the time the promotional low rate is added to your account on \r\n\r\nMarch 4, 2026 \r\n, \r\n\r\nprovided you activate the offer by \r\n\r\nFebruary 20, 2026 \r\n \r\n\r\nand your account remains open and in good standing. A confirmation email will be sent to you when your offer is activated. If you received a notice from us that your interest rates will increase due to two missed payments in a 12-month period, the interest rate of 9.99% will no longer apply and your interest rate will increase as set out in your notice. This offer may be changed or withdrawn without notice and is only valid for the account referenced in the attached offer and is not transferable. From the time the promotional purchase interest rates are added to your account, any other installment plan programs from BMO will not be applicable to your account during the period of the promotional rates.\r\n\r\n \r\n2. The promotional purchase interest rate of 9.99% for purchases is effective until August 31, 2026 \r\n. After this date, any remaining outstanding balance amounts from purchases will be charged interest at the standard annual interest rate. Please refer to your monthly statement for the interest rate applicable to your account. \r\n\r\n \r\n3. If you accept any other promotional offer prior to the expiry of your existing offer, your existing offer may be withdrawn. This does not apply to promotional balance transfer offers. \r\n\r\n \r\n4. If you make credit card product changes after the promotional purchase interest rate is added to your account, you will lose the promotional purchase interest rate of 9.99% and the standard interest rates of the new credit card product will apply to your existing balance. \r\n\r\n5. \r\nFor residents outside of Quebec, \r\nif your account has balances with different interest rates, such as purchases with a standard interest rate and purchases with a promotional interest rate, any payment that exceeds the minimum payment will be allocated proportionately to those balances according to the terms set out in the BMO Credit Card Cardholder Agreement. For example, if you have a balance of $800 in purchases at the standard interest rate and a $200 purchase balance at a promotional interest rate, 80 percent of your payment will be allocated to your purchases with standard interest rate and 20 percent will be allocated to your purchases balance with promotional interest rate.\r\n\r\nFor residents of Quebec, \r\nif your account has balances with different interest rates, such as purchases with a standard interest rate and purchases with a promotional interest rate, any payment that exceeds the minimum payment will apply first to those balances with the highest credit rate, then to other balances in decreasing order of credit rate according to the terms set out in the BMO Credit Card Cardholder Agreement. For example, if you have a balance of $800 in purchases at the standard interest rate and a balance of $200 in purchases at a promotional interest rate, and the standard interest rate is higher than the promotional interest rate, 100 percent of your payment will first be allocated to your $800\r\n purchases balance at the standard interest rate and once the $800 is paid off, any excess payments made will be allocated to your $200 purchase balance at a promotional rate.  Electronic Delivery of Expiration Notices: By accepting this offer, you are providing express consent that we may provide you with notices electronically, that your promotional interest rate is expiring when: (i) you have provided us with your email address; (ii) you are registered for and use BMO Online Banking; or (iii) you have requested to receive your statements electronically.

      "body": "Hi Max\r\n\r\nI have a draft. I think it would be good for you to review and then we can \r\nconsider next steps.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t have a preference with regards to mediation/arbitration. My \r\npreference is what is best for me. I always imagined that this document \r\nwould be air tight and not require?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nfundamentally, each party is entitled to dispute resolution. i do agree \r\nthat arbitration only is preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t think it will be in my interest to negotiate. I would be interested \r\nin it, as long as it could only be triggered by me.\r\n\r\nagreed. I prefer to focus on finality. if the two of you genuinely decide \r\nand agree to revisit / renegotiate that is always possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most relevant provisions are 8 and 10. Especially 8(b) and 8(e). 8(b) \r\nsets out the baseline deal of 1.5% \"dividend\". 8(e) sets out the right to \r\nthe house if you walk away from the relationship. The challenge is that \r\n8(e) is about property but the terms that you are seeking to achieve uses \r\nthe property as support. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ontario family law, property and support are seen as two distinct silos.\r\n\r\n   1. \r\n   \r\n   *Property silo*\r\n   - \r\n      \r\n      Ownership, equalization, tracing, constructive/resulting trust\r\n      - \r\n      \r\n      Governed primarily by the Family Law Act (Part I) and equity\r\n      - \r\n      \r\n      Less difficult to contract out of\r\n      2. \r\n   \r\n   *Support silo*\r\n   - \r\n      \r\n      Compensatory, non-compensatory, needs-based support\r\n      - \r\n      \r\n      Governed by Divorce Act / Family Law Act\r\n      - \r\n      \r\n      Only partially contractable; always subject to residual judicial \r\n      supervision. \r\n      \r\n\r\nA family lawyer would recommend to use the cohab to coordinate but not \r\nblend property and support.\r\n\r\nthe terms we started off with used property as a substitute for support, \r\nand in doing so collapsed the silos. \r\n\r\nThere are two principal examples:\r\n\r\n\r\n   - Property used as satisfaction of support via the “Enhanced Settlement \r\n   Amount\"\r\n   - Support indexed to corporate economics because the agreement ties \r\n   periodic spousal support to Mascore’s distributable income. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Why “cross-contamination” is the right term \r\n\r\nCalling this “cross-contamination” is not rhetorical; it is analytically \r\naccurate.\r\n\r\nOnce property is used as support:\r\n\r\n   - \r\n   \r\n   property waivers are no longer cleanly severable from support provisions;\r\n   - \r\n   \r\n   courts are more willing to reopen property consequences when varying \r\n   support; and\r\n   - \r\n   \r\n   the agreement loses the normal insulation where “property survives, \r\n   support fails.”\r\n   \r\nIn other words, the client’s instinct (use property to satisfy support) is \r\nunderstandable, but the execution *weakens both sides of the contract*.\r\n------------------------------\r\n4. The client’s objective vs. the legal risk \r\n\r\nThe client’s objective appears to be:\r\n\r\n   - \r\n   \r\n   avoid long-term cash-flow support exposure;\r\n   - \r\n   \r\n   cap downside risk on relationship breakdown; and\r\n   - \r\n   \r\n   use hard assets (house equity) as a release valve.\r\n   \r\nThat objective is legitimate.\r\n\r\nThe problem is *where* it is being implemented.\r\n\r\nDoing this inside the *support silo* invites:\r\n\r\n   - \r\n   \r\n   unconscionability analysis;\r\n   - \r\n   \r\n   fault scrutiny; and\r\n   - \r\n   \r\n   judicial re-characterization.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n*Matthew AJ* *Levine*\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and \r\nis only to be used by the intended recipient.

I have the FDD, thank you.\r\n\r\nAt a preliminary level, I have questions about how the transaction was structured, particularly in relation to the franchise agreement that was entered into and the fee that was paid. To start with, can you confirm whether a $70,000 initial franchise fee was paid, and whether you were given an explanation at the time for why the transaction was treated as a new franchise rather than a transfer or change of control?\r\n\r\nBefore I can assess whether there is a legal issue to be examined, it would be helpful to make sure I understand the situation from your perspective. In particular:\r\n\r\n  *   What concern or issue prompted you to reach out now?\r\n\r\n  *   Who was responsible for day-to-day management of the business at the time of the transaction, and how was that role described to you?\r\n\r\n  *   Were you told that any individual’s continued involvement was expected or required when the deal was completed?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is that issues involving disclosure and transaction structure are treated differently from operational or personnel disputes, and I want to be clear on the factual background.\r\n\r\nOnce I have that context, we can discuss whether there is a legal issue worth pursuing and what the appropriate next steps might be.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

Мы приезжаем круглосуточно во все районы — от Уралмаша до Академического — и запускаем персональную схему стабилизации прямо у вас дома: экспресс-оценка, титрованные капельницы через инфузомат, защита желудка, контроль сердечного ритма, настройка сна и питьевого режима. В целях конфиденциальности специалисты приезжают без медицинской символики, документы формулируются нейтрально, уведомления — «тихие», а при желании оформляется кодовый профиль. Так мы снимаем стигму и возвращаем человеку чувство контроля уже в первые часы. \r\nРазобраться лучше - <a href=\"https://narcolog-na-dom-ekaterinburg0.ru/\" / rel=\"nofollow ugc\">помощь нарколога на дому екатеринбург</a>\r\n\r\nApprove it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=approve&c=15101#wpbody-content\r\nTrash it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=trash&c=15101#wpbody-content\r\nSpam it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=spam&c=15101#wpbody-content\r\nCurrently 15,100 comments are waiting for approval.

      "body": "View this post on the web at https://edgarems.substack.com/p/project-finance-as-a-core-growth\r\n\r\nThe M&A Baseline Before the Rise of Project Finance\r\nFor decades, mergers and acquisitions has been the primary practice area through which foreign-qualified lawyers built careers in Japan. Japan’s role as a major cross-border investment destination required international law firms to maintain strong M&A benches in Tokyo, often staffed by lawyers qualified in the US, UK, Australia, and other common-law jurisdictions.\r\nWhile other practices periodically gained traction among foreign lawyers, M&A remained structurally dominant. It aligned with Japan’s inbound and outbound investment flows, required international documentation standards, and benefited from recurring transactional cycles.\r\nThat hierarchy, however, is no longer static.\r\nOutside M&A, several practice areas have seen increased demand for foreign-qualified lawyers in Tokyo. Among them, energy and infrastructure project finance stands out for both scale and durability.\r\nAfter two exceptionally busy years and with visible demand building into 2026, project finance has shifted from a complementary practice to a strategic priority. This is not only a hiring story, but a reflection of how capital deployment in Japan and the broader region is evolving.\r\nHow Large is Project Finance Hiring in Tokyo?\r\nBefore addressing the data, a caveat is necessary.\r\nTracking hiring trends in Tokyo’s energy and infrastructure legal market is inherently imperfect. Any dataset limited to lawyers currently in private practice will undercount prior cycles, as senior lawyers may have moved in-house, relocated, or exited the market altogether. Historical comparisons should therefore be read directionally rather than as precise headcount measurements.\r\nWith that limitation in mind, a clear pattern still emerges.\r\nBased on a review of foreign-qualified lawyers currently practicing energy and infrastructure project finance within Tokyo-based private practice teams, hiring has accelerated materially over the last four years, with a pronounced concentration in 2024 and 2025.\r\nBetween 2016 and 2020, annual joins were consistently in the low single digits. These hires largely reflected replacement hiring or isolated strategic additions. From 2021 onward, volumes increased meaningfully, rising to six to nine joins per year through 2022 and 2023.\r\nIn 2024, foreign-qualified project finance hiring rose again, with fourteen recored joins. A further thirteen joins have already been identified in 2025. (Refer to Graph 1)\r\nNotably, a large share of the 2024 cohort joined in the second half of the year. This suggests firms were not merely reacting to completed transactions, but hiring in anticipation of increased activity.\r\nThat interpretation reinforced by early-2026 dynamics. Despite the year only just beginning, multiple international law firms in Tokyo are actively recruiting foreign-qualified project finance lawyers across associate, counsel, and partner levels.\r\nWhat Changed Over the Past Decade?\r\nFrom 2016 to 2025, energy and infrastructure moved from a steady, long-cycle sector into a capital-heavy transition cycle. The clearest quantitative signal is the scale and speed of energy investment growth since 2020. The IEA estimates global energy investment is set to exceed USD 3 trillion in 2024, with USD 2 trillion directed to clean energy technologies and infrastructure, including renewables, grids, and storage. By 2025, BloombergNEF estimates global energy transition investment alone reached USD 2.3 trillion, up 8% YoY, with large allocations to electrified transport, renewables, and grids. In other words, the market experienced not only more projects, but more projects that were finance-intensive, cross-border, and contract-heavy, which is exactly the profile that increases demand for sophisticated project finance legal support.\r\nRegionally, Asia sits ant the center of that pipeline because the underlying infrastructure requirement remains massive and multi-decade. The Asian Development Bank estimated developing Asia would need USD 26 trillion of infrastructure investment from 2016 to 2030, or roughly USD 1.7 trillion per year, to maintain growth momentum and address infrastructure gaps. Japan links directly into that regional cycle as a sponsor and financing hub, while also building its domestic transition pipeline.\r\nMETI has framed Green Transformation as a ten-year investment agenda, stating more than JPY 150 trillion of public-private investment is required over the next decade, with JPY 20 trillion of GC Economy Transition Bonds to support it. On the project side, offshore wind moved from policy to awarded pipeline. NEDO materials describer Round 1 auctions finalized in 2021 with 1.7 GQ awarded, and Japan’s Strategic Energy Plan sets ambitions to form 10GW of projects by 2030 and 30 to 45 GW by 2040.\r\nJapan also tightened its long-term decarbonization trajectory in its UNFCC submission, targeting 60 % emissions reduction by FY2035 and 73% by FY2040 from FY2013 levels. Together, these shifts help explain why Tokyo-based firms expanded benches of foreign-qualified project finance lawyers: more capital, more cross-border structures, and more projects where international financing standards and documentation norms are decisive.\r\nRare Earth Materials and Project Finance Demand\r\nCritical minerals, including REMs, have become a further driver of project finance demand since 2020, accelerating sharply over the past year as economies outside China seek supply chain resilience.\r\nAs energy transition technologies scale, mining, processing, and refining projects are increasingly financed on standalone or structured basis rather than through corporate balance sheets. Demand for critical minerals used in clean energy technologies is expected to multiply by 2030.\r\nFor Japan-based sponsors and lenders, these projects are often overseas and involve long-term offtake arrangements, political risk mitigation, export credit agency support, and development finance participation. Structurally, they resemble classic project finance transactions rather than conventional M&A.\r\nAs a result, international project finance documentation and market-standard structures are becoming more prevalent, reinforcing demand for foreign-qualified lawyers within Tokyo-based private practice teams.\r\nWhat This Means for 2026 and Beyond\r\nEarly 2026 signals point to continued expansion rather than normalization.\r\nAs of February, multiple international law firms in Tokyo are actively seeking to add foreign-qualified E&I lawyers. Importantly, these searches are not driven by attrition. They are capacity-driven.\r\nAcross the market, firms cite similar factors. Deal pipelines are growing. Lead times for project finance mandates are lengthening. Energy transition, infrastructure, LNG transition assets, and critical minerals work increasingly overlap.\r\nThis matters because project finance hiring typically precedes deal execution. Firms build capacity ahead of bid stages, lender panel appointments, and financial close cycles. The current hiring activity therefore reflects expectations of sustained workload through 2026 and beyond, not just recent deal flow.\r\nTaken together, these dynamics suggest that project finance is no longer a niche or counter-cyclical practice within Tokyo’s foreign-qualified legal market. It is becoming a core strategic capability, increasingly comparable to M&A in headcount importance and long-term relevance.\r\nIf the previous decade was defined by cross-border corporate transactions, the next may be defined by cross-border capital deployment into assets. For foreign-qualified lawyers in Tokyo, project finance is no longer an alternative track It is rapidly becoming one of the main ones.\r\nSources\r\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA), World Energy Investment 2024\r\nhttps://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2024/overview-and-key-findings [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/e09e5301-5672-448e-8dbf-7d8619c16f5e?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nBloombergNEF, Energy Transition Investment Trends 2025\r\nhttps://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/bloombergnef-finds-global-energy-transition-investment-reached-record-2-3-trillion-in-2025-up-8-from-2024/ [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/03811a80-24a4-4095-a55f-5a7e5df9f92d?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nAsian Development Bank (ADB), Asia Infrastructure Needs: Meeting the Challenge\r\nhttps://www.adb.org/publications/asia-infrastructure-needs [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/de1e27d5-1aa8-4581-b470-7f4192b1a851?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nMinistry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Japan, Green Transformation (GX) Policy and Transition Finance\r\nhttps://www.meti.go.jp/english/policy/energy_environment/transition_finance/index.html [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/2b9e07d4-1905-4557-97f6-5ff78da6233a?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nMETI / Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE), Strategic Energy Plan\r\nhttps://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/category/others/basic_plan/ [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/7d06e556-f80e-4c30-a6b8-3278eec13085?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nNew Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Offshore Wind Auction Results (Round 1)\r\nhttps://www.nedo.go.jp/content/100949197.pdf [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/363c4f49-4f4c-4423-9041-472b9a1ba727?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nESGian, Results of Japan’s Second Offshore Wind Round\r\nhttps://esgian.com/2023/12/13/results-of-second-offshore-wind-round-in-japan-announced/ [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/3bfba165-72c3-4408-949f-8a3d75d17b24?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nWhite & Case, Japan Offshore Wind: Round 3 Results\r\nhttps://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/japan-offshore-wind-update-round-3-results [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/78e1233e-19f3-4b6c-8cb7-347363436534?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nUNFCCC, Japan’s 2035–2040 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)\r\nhttps://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-02/Japans%202035-2040%20NDC.pdf [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/de9a876b-4dfb-482a-95d1-2c1a42701ba5?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA), The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions\r\nhttps://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/7bcbabc4-9b53-492c-892b-ffd5b417992e?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9lZGdhcmVtcy5zdWJzdGFjay5jb20vYWN0aW9uL2Rpc2FibGVfZW1haWw_dG9rZW49ZXlKMWMyVnlYMmxrSWpvek5UVXhORE00TURjc0luQnZjM1JmYVdRaU9qRTROek0yTmpVNE5Dd2lhV0YwSWpveE56Y3dOakl6TURNM0xDSmxlSEFpT2pFNE1ESXhOVGt3TXpjc0ltbHpjeUk2SW5CMVlpMDJORE0zTVRVeUlpd2ljM1ZpSWpvaVpHbHpZV0pzWlY5bGJXRnBiQ0o5LmZwS0dVMzlNbjRNVUw5eXJUQm9hMU5FMi1LeW1yT0g3SVk3SkYwVU9kUGsiLCJwIjoxODczNjY1ODQsInMiOjY0MzcxNTIsImYiOnRydWUsInUiOjM1NTE0MzgwNywiaWF0IjoxNzcwNjIzMDM3LCJleHAiOjIwODYxOTkwMzcsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0wIiwic3ViIjoibGluay1yZWRpcmVjdCJ9.qGMZo-PmtRNjH-fqPXTIIxLmzm_aSZWlDHwbOaa20Io?",

I wanted to connect regarding where things currently stand.\r\n\r\nI know Yash spoke with you and the plan was to reconnect mid February.

The Franchisor terminated the franchise agreement for the Liberty village franchise as stated in the termination notice delivered to your client. The Franchisor never agreed to act as your client's sales agent for the equipment. Rather, in an attempt to mitigate its losses, the franchisor agreed to try to coordinate the sale of the equipment between all interested parties, your client, your client's bank and either the franchisor or a designated purchaser. The Franchisor has advised that they have not received any purchase and sales agreement from your client's bank and therefore, due to such bank's security interest in the equipment, cannot proceed with any sort of sale. As the Franchisor is not acting on your client's behalf, your client can contact their bank directly to find out what is delaying the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the franchisor has not heard of any developments since our last communication in mid-December.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\n\r\n<Outlook-A black an.png>\r\n\r\n\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\nIndependent Contractor Lawyer\r\n\r\nT:  (416) 797-6426\r\n\r\nE:  janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca<mailto:janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis e-mail may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure.

The equipment is subject to a security interest held by BMO.\r\n\r\nMy client is prepared to cooperate in making the equipment available for the franchisor’s intended disposition, with the understanding that the transfer process will need to address the lender’s requirements so that title can pass cleanly.\r\n\r\nAttached is a draft Release and Waiver Agreement.

As you know, my firm acts for Kishmish Inc. (the “Franchisee”) and Yash Raj and Jyotika Luthra (the “Franchisee Principals”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter sustained operating losses and escalating costs, Kishmish has undertaken a financial and strategic review of its business viability. The review confirmed that continued operation under the existing structure is no longer feasible. My clients wish to ensure that any transition occurs in an orderly and cooperative manner that protects the brand, the premises, and all parties’ interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, and without prejudice to any of Kishmish’s legal or statutory rights, we are instructed to open a dialogue with you to structure a mutual termination and surrender process on the following framework:\r\n\r\n  1.  Orderly Transition – Kishmish will coordinate a prompt wind-down of operations, return of keys, turnover of the premises and equipment in good order, and transfer of employees on a schedule acceptable to Nani’s.\r\n  2.  Orderly Surrender – Upon delivery of vacant possession, Nani’s will accept surrender of the sublease and franchise location in satisfaction of Kishmish’s remaining obligations.\r\n  3.  Mutual Release – The parties will execute a mutual release confirming that no further claims will be made by either party, other than those that may be expressly provided in the release and waiver documentation.\r\n  4.  Brand Protection and Confidentiality – Kishmish will return all confidential materials and intellectual-property assets in accordance with the franchise agreement. It will enter into a confidentiality agreement on mutually acceptable terms.\r\n\r\nKishmish continues to operate in good faith pending these discussions and is prepared to cooperate fully in a controlled handover that minimizes disruption.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm a convenient time to discuss. We would appreciate receiving your acknowledgement so that we can promptly coordinate next steps.\r\n\r\nAll of our client’s statutory, contractual, and equitable rights are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\n\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

I wanted to connect regarding where things currently stand.\r\n\r\nI know Yash spoke with you and the plan was to reconnect mid February.

The Franchisor terminated the franchise agreement for the Liberty village franchise as stated in the termination notice delivered to your client. The Franchisor never agreed to act as your client's sales agent for the equipment. Rather, in an attempt to mitigate its losses, the franchisor agreed to try to coordinate the sale of the equipment between all interested parties, your client, your client's bank and either the franchisor or a designated purchaser. The Franchisor has advised that they have not received any purchase and sales agreement from your client's bank and therefore, due to such bank's security interest in the equipment, cannot proceed with any sort of sale. As the Franchisor is not acting on your client's behalf, your client can contact their bank directly to find out what is delaying the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the franchisor has not heard of any developments since our last communication in mid-December.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\n\r\n<Outlook-A black an.png>\r\n\r\n\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\nIndependent Contractor Lawyer\r\n\r\nT:  (416) 797-6426\r\n\r\nE:  janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca<mailto:janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis e-mail may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure.

As you know, my firm acts for Kishmish Inc. (the “Franchisee”) and Yash Raj and Jyotika Luthra (the “Franchisee Principals”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter sustained operating losses and escalating costs, Kishmish has undertaken a financial and strategic review of its business viability. The review confirmed that continued operation under the existing structure is no longer feasible. My clients wish to ensure that any transition occurs in an orderly and cooperative manner that protects the brand, the premises, and all parties’ interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, and without prejudice to any of Kishmish’s legal or statutory rights, we are instructed to open a dialogue with you to structure a mutual termination and surrender process on the following framework:\r\n\r\n  1.  Orderly Transition – Kishmish will coordinate a prompt wind-down of operations, return of keys, turnover of the premises and equipment in good order, and transfer of employees on a schedule acceptable to Nani’s.\r\n  2.  Orderly Surrender – Upon delivery of vacant possession, Nani’s will accept surrender of the sublease and franchise location in satisfaction of Kishmish’s remaining obligations.\r\n  3.  Mutual Release – The parties will execute a mutual release confirming that no further claims will be made by either party, other than those that may be expressly provided in the release and waiver documentation.\r\n  4.  Brand Protection and Confidentiality – Kishmish will return all confidential materials and intellectual-property assets in accordance with the franchise agreement. It will enter into a confidentiality agreement on mutually acceptable terms.\r\n\r\nKishmish continues to operate in good faith pending these discussions and is prepared to cooperate fully in a controlled handover that minimizes disruption.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm a convenient time to discuss. We would appreciate receiving your acknowledgement so that we can promptly coordinate next steps.\r\n\r\nAll of our client’s statutory, contractual, and equitable rights are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\n\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

I wanted to connect regarding where things currently stand.\r\n\r\nI know Yash spoke with you and the plan was to reconnect mid February. At this point, several pieces remain up in the air—particularly following our last communication with the bank, where there is still no clear direction on the status of the equipment.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this ongoing uncertainty has left us in a more difficult financial position. While we are very grateful for the flexibility provided through the payment plan, we are not currently in a position to make the final installment owed. Based on the invoices we’ve received, I do believe we are otherwise up to date on payments to date.\r\n\r\nGiven the circumstances, we would like to respectfully request to cease our retainer at this time and, if possible, not proceed with the final payment. This is not a reflection of your efforts, but rather our current financial constraints and the lack of forward momentum we are able to act on.\r\n\r\nShould our situation change and we find ourselves in a position to move forward meaningfully, would it be acceptable for us to reach out to you again at that time to potentially resume services?\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and support, and we appreciate your understanding.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nJyotika Luthra\r\n+1 647 673 0412\r\n\r\nExcuse any typos or errors.

The Franchisor terminated the franchise agreement for the Liberty village franchise as stated in the termination notice delivered to your client. The Franchisor never agreed to act as your client's sales agent for the equipment. Rather, in an attempt to mitigate its losses, the franchisor agreed to try to coordinate the sale of the equipment between all interested parties, your client, your client's bank and either the franchisor or a designated purchaser. The Franchisor has advised that they have not received any purchase and sales agreement from your client's bank and therefore, due to such bank's security interest in the equipment, cannot proceed with any sort of sale. As the Franchisor is not acting on your client's behalf, your client can contact their bank directly to find out what is delaying the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the franchisor has not heard of any developments since our last communication in mid-December.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\n\r\n<Outlook-A black an.png>\r\n\r\n\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\nIndependent Contractor Lawyer\r\n\r\nT:  (416) 797-6426\r\n\r\nE:  janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca<mailto:janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis e-mail may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure.

As you know, my firm acts for Kishmish Inc. (the “Franchisee”) and Yash Raj and Jyotika Luthra (the “Franchisee Principals”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter sustained operating losses and escalating costs, Kishmish has undertaken a financial and strategic review of its business viability. The review confirmed that continued operation under the existing structure is no longer feasible. My clients wish to ensure that any transition occurs in an orderly and cooperative manner that protects the brand, the premises, and all parties’ interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, and without prejudice to any of Kishmish’s legal or statutory rights, we are instructed to open a dialogue with you to structure a mutual termination and surrender process on the following framework:\r\n\r\n  1.  Orderly Transition – Kishmish will coordinate a prompt wind-down of operations, return of keys, turnover of the premises and equipment in good order, and transfer of employees on a schedule acceptable to Nani’s.\r\n  2.  Orderly Surrender – Upon delivery of vacant possession, Nani’s will accept surrender of the sublease and franchise location in satisfaction of Kishmish’s remaining obligations.\r\n  3.  Mutual Release – The parties will execute a mutual release confirming that no further claims will be made by either party, other than those that may be expressly provided in the release and waiver documentation.\r\n  4.  Brand Protection and Confidentiality – Kishmish will return all confidential materials and intellectual-property assets in accordance with the franchise agreement. It will enter into a confidentiality agreement on mutually acceptable terms.\r\n\r\nKishmish continues to operate in good faith pending these discussions and is prepared to cooperate fully in a controlled handover that minimizes disruption.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm a convenient time to discuss. We would appreciate receiving your acknowledgement so that we can promptly coordinate next steps.\r\n\r\nAll of our client’s statutory, contractual, and equitable rights are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\n\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

I wanted to connect regarding where things currently stand.\r\n\r\nI know Yash spoke with you and the plan was to reconnect mid February. At this point, several pieces remain up in the air—particularly following our last communication with the bank, where there is still no clear direction on the status of the equipment.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this ongoing uncertainty has left us in a more difficult financial position. While we are very grateful for the flexibility provided through the payment plan, we are not currently in a position to make the final installment owed. Based on the invoices we’ve received, I do believe we are otherwise up to date on payments to date.\r\n\r\nGiven the circumstances, we would like to respectfully request to cease our retainer at this time and, if possible, not proceed with the final payment. This is not a reflection of your efforts, but rather our current financial constraints and the lack of forward momentum we are able to act on.\r\n\r\nShould our situation change and we find ourselves in a position to move forward meaningfully, would it be acceptable for us to reach out to you again at that time to potentially resume services?\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and support, and we appreciate your understanding.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nJyotika Luthra\r\n+1 647 673 0412\r\n\r\nExcuse any typos or errors.

The Franchisor terminated the franchise agreement for the Liberty village franchise as stated in the termination notice delivered to your client. The Franchisor never agreed to act as your client's sales agent for the equipment. Rather, in an attempt to mitigate its losses, the franchisor agreed to try to coordinate the sale of the equipment between all interested parties, your client, your client's bank and either the franchisor or a designated purchaser. The Franchisor has advised that they have not received any purchase and sales agreement from your client's bank and therefore, due to such bank's security interest in the equipment, cannot proceed with any sort of sale. As the Franchisor is not acting on your client's behalf, your client can contact their bank directly to find out what is delaying the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the franchisor has not heard of any developments since our last communication in mid-December.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\n\r\n<Outlook-A black an.png>\r\n\r\n\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\nIndependent Contractor Lawyer\r\n\r\nT:  (416) 797-6426\r\n\r\nE:  janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca<mailto:janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis e-mail may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure.

As you know, my firm acts for Kishmish Inc. (the “Franchisee”) and Yash Raj and Jyotika Luthra (the “Franchisee Principals”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter sustained operating losses and escalating costs, Kishmish has undertaken a financial and strategic review of its business viability. The review confirmed that continued operation under the existing structure is no longer feasible. My clients wish to ensure that any transition occurs in an orderly and cooperative manner that protects the brand, the premises, and all parties’ interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, and without prejudice to any of Kishmish’s legal or statutory rights, we are instructed to open a dialogue with you to structure a mutual termination and surrender process on the following framework:\r\n\r\n  1.  Orderly Transition – Kishmish will coordinate a prompt wind-down of operations, return of keys, turnover of the premises and equipment in good order, and transfer of employees on a schedule acceptable to Nani’s.\r\n  2.  Orderly Surrender – Upon delivery of vacant possession, Nani’s will accept surrender of the sublease and franchise location in satisfaction of Kishmish’s remaining obligations.\r\n  3.  Mutual Release – The parties will execute a mutual release confirming that no further claims will be made by either party, other than those that may be expressly provided in the release and waiver documentation.\r\n  4.  Brand Protection and Confidentiality – Kishmish will return all confidential materials and intellectual-property assets in accordance with the franchise agreement. It will enter into a confidentiality agreement on mutually acceptable terms.\r\n\r\nKishmish continues to operate in good faith pending these discussions and is prepared to cooperate fully in a controlled handover that minimizes disruption.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm a convenient time to discuss. We would appreciate receiving your acknowledgement so that we can promptly coordinate next steps.\r\n\r\nAll of our client’s statutory, contractual, and equitable rights are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\n\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

Orderly Surrender – Upon delivery of vacant possession, Nani’s will\r\n>    accept surrender of the sublease and franchise location in satisfaction of\r\n>    Kishmish’s remaining obligations.\r\n>    3. Mutual Release – The parties will execute a mutual release\r\n>    confirming that no further claims will be made by either party, other than\r\n>    those that may be expressly provided in the release and waiver\r\n>    documentation.\r\n>    4.

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as Omar and I enjoyed the conversation.\r\nThere have been obvious and perceptible changes in the world of investment management with the arrival of AI. Even as some of them are clearly visible (and further, clearly transformative) they hardly receive warranted attention.\r\nAmong them is a new cadre of empowered buyers, who have always been ever-present in the decision-making calculus of private fund managers: CFOs and COOs.\r\nTo be blunt, while AI has transformed the ability to do work, it has made the administration associated with its implementation and adoption much more difficult. \r\nThat is, technology never comes with a playbook on how it should be used, only the fact that it must be used. Its most confident originators are excellent in touting this inevitability, and the torrent of compulsion to use it creates much of the confusion we see in operating teams today.\r\nFurther, and as such, the absolute emergence of AI and the overwhelming flood of AI solutions for the endless array of manual human activity has sharpened the need for pivotal decision-making from these buyers.\r\nSomehow—perhaps unknowingly and unwillingly—they were given the enormous task of evaluating the quality of that flood, ensuring an appropriate analysis and implementation, and further expected to do so confidently and efficiently, alongside and in addition to their traditional work.\r\nThese professionals are astute observers to the blunderbuss sanguinity of this era’s greatest technological innovation. At once they are also keenly aware of the thing left to utter abandon by AI’s greatest champions, the human touch, now a common retroactive marketing gambit many AI companies employ as they run up against the stormy realities of implementation and adoption.\r\nCould there be a more obvious admission than this oblique promotional pivot that technology was neither the complete answer nor the primary one to the most pressing challenges in high finance?\r\nOn these matters, I recently had the honored pleasure of speaking to one of the industry’s sharpest voices: Omar Hassan, CFO and COO of the esoteric, captivating investment manager, Cloverlay.\r\nAs the first fever of excitement around AI began to cool, we found ourselves drawn toward weightier questions. Less about what the technology could do, and more about what kind of future it was arranging for us, one in which its presence would be as unavoidable as it was ordinary.\r\nThe Esoteric Play\r\nCloverlay positions its investment thesis on the premise of “adjacent” private markets. Investment opportunities that have existed outside the conventional preserve of private equity and private credit.\r\nHis views on technology and as a buyer standing at the gates of the AI-induced flood are anything but conventional.\r\n“I take a nontraditional view on a lot of these topics. What [tech] people traditionally want to do is ask, ‘what’s your problem?’ Or ‘what’s causing you stress?’”\r\nHe paused before answering his own question.\r\nFor me, it always comes back to something else: “Why should I care?”\r\nTime as Investment\r\nFrom a COO’s vantage point, time is the greatest scarcity. It presses in from every side, allowing no room for abstractions, no indulgence in ideas that demand faith before proof. Each new system arrives already under suspicion, compelled to justify itself immediately or be dismissed as yet another burden disguised as some sort of salvation.\r\n“It has to be a no-brainer,” Omar said. “Very little implementation.”\r\nThis is where the language of sales begins to feel almost distasteful. Its grand promises of transformation ring loudly, and yet collapse under the inward severity of operational life, where nothing is forgiven just because it sounds convincing.\r\n“I get really annoyed when they say, ‘this will save you ninety percent of your time,’” Omar continued. “When push comes to shove, you’re still on calls telling people what they need to do.”\r\nFor operations teams in large organizations, this can take dozens of hours a month.\r\nThe time drag sharpens because of a lack of disciplinary context. In other words, does the person across the table understand how things work?\r\n“Do you know my business?” he stated.\r\nAccount executives and the garden variety salesforce have little to offer in this manner of things.\r\nBut for many account managers, securing a demo feels like progress. For the operator, it is already an investment.\r\n“If you’re asking why I should care,” Omar said, “you better not waste my time. There’s an element of: my thinking, my ideas, time, and data are not free. Because I know that’s the value they’ll get out of it.”\r\n“It sounds less about product, and more about messaging and marketing,” I responded, stating the plainly obvious (as I tend to do).\r\nOmar agreed. But there was an attendant point about how tech companies position their value, and he was livid about the lack of transparency.\r\n“These tech companies will say they will let the data work for you. They are obviously leaving out the how, and they want to show you that in the demo.”\r\nIs there a saving grace for precious operational daylight?\r\n“I’m a big believer in the shorts. The quick demo video shorts not just a video that re explains the problem that is being tried to solve. Time is very valuable.”\r\nKilling a Tool\r\nIf one is able to get past the obstacle of time, to the point of a pilot or implementation, new hazards emerge. Still, certain principles persist.\r\n“I have to feel like it is way easier.”\r\nNo tradeoffs.\r\nOmar gave the example of Concur, the expense reporting tool. “It’s not…cool...but it works for the whole manager.”\r\nAnd migrating to something new, even if it is technically better, has sunk costs that are generally hard to overcome. “If we go to another expense software, there are noticeable tradeoffs even if the product is better.”\r\nThe white-glove service that fund managers are typically used to figures centrally into the arithmetic: “I just don’t want to engage unless you are holistically solving a particular pain or you tell me exactly how I’m doing it when we are talking.”\r\nThis is something of an unspoken (and at worst, unknown) hurdle swashbuckling tech companies servicing fund managers struggle to understand. A private equity fund is used to calling up professional service providers that can produce anything—a CIM, LPA, market deck, etc.—to the exact specifications of the VP or managing director.\r\nThat’s why lawyers and bankers can charge so much, and their clients are willing to pay for it (there are other considerations, but this one is a mainstay!).\r\nA fund manager is used to be treated like a client, not a customer. What’s more, Omar mentioned, is that much of the salesforce have probably never worked at a fund manager before.\r\nAnecdotally, I recently recall having a conversation with a fintech that provides retail access to the private markets. The account executive didn’t know what a 3(c)(7) fund was. And if you are a broker dealer (which these types of businesses are), you are in the business of selling interests in a third-party fund. So to not know the type of fund, which has implications for the kind of people you sell too, can be reflective of the company’s foundational basis.\r\nThis is perhaps to harsh an assessment of the conventional venture-backed tech company.\r\nTo meet the expectations of the venture world’s increasingly aggressive demands for scale, the tech companies aren’t entirely to blame either. As a white-glove service provider, Kirkland & Ellis generated over $7 billion in revenue last year as the nation’s top grossing law firm.\r\nHarvey, Silicon Valley’s legal AI darling, is already worth $8 billion in its 3-and-a-half-year existence.\r\nThe high pressure to grow spills into pushy behavior. As Omar put it, “There are elements of overselling” that are sources of significant consternation.\r\nWhat’s worse is the stuff left out, only to be revealed at painfully inconvenient moments. Somewhat regretfully, Omar recalled a compliance system that had a feature he really liked. “What drove me crazy was that during the implementation phase the team left out as to whether it was going to work.”\r\nAnd this type of incident isn’t isolated. “There’s a lot of ‘tell us what we want to hear, but sell us what they want to sell’.” While it is useful to have a meeting of the minds, the typical posture of a tech salesforce is that it can get challenging to close when it feels, as Omar put it, “like they are messing with you.”\r\nEvaluating Failures\r\nThere is a clear desire among the operations team at fund managers to be cognizant of a trustworthy salesperson. This isn’t a unique mindset, and the forces driving it are equally ubiquitous.\r\nPart of that awareness comes in the form of founder experience. Cloverlay was an early adopter of a software for which one of the founders was an investment professional. “They knew what we needed.”\r\nThe technical know-how trickles down through company culture, and is the basis of an informed salesforce.\r\nThe one thing which Omar was clear any good account executive should avoid: “Don’t ask the magic wand question.” An expert-led tech company wouldn’t ever need to go down this cliched script.\r\nAssuming a tech company can get past the initial stage of implementation, there are nonetheless evident signs that the rollout lacked the teeth to be truly useful.\r\nBut let’s say it is useful, and the customer is happy.\r\nCan that level of satisfaction endure beyond the narrow time horizon of a venture capitalist outlook? Even as this class of investor is struggling to itself return capital to its limited partner base—it can easily take 12-14 years after the initial “close” of the fund, which is when the first batch of investors is formally admitted—the ideal assumption for a fund manager, or any customer for that matter, is that as prices increase, so should the quality of service.\r\nThe reality is murkier, and even when things are clear, they aren’t pretty.\r\nFor managers that have illiquid strategies like Cloverlay, this plays out in the medium to long term. “There has to be a better way where you are taking care of your legacy clients” that are captive to the software.\r\nAccount success teams, as they are usually referred to in traditional SaaS, are tasked with maintaining continued relations with existing customers and driving retention. This can also involve upselling new products from time to time.\r\nWhen these teams fall short, it comes out in the form of tiered experiences for the customer base. It’s not that someone paying less should receive the same treatment as someone paying 10x more. But that the sense of care given shouldn’t be any different.\r\nOptimists might say customers are a genuine part of a software’s cohesive ecosystem. Omar’s posture is skeptical: “They [legacy providers] know that for us to think of an integration project [namely, data migration] with someone else, it’ll take months.”\r\nPerhaps what legacy providers struggle with most is the visible practice of care: the ongoing demonstration that a customer’s success remains an active concern.\r\nReliance on the product only sharpens the tension. When dependency turns into a feeling of entrapment, it is usually the clearest signal that the relationship itself has atrophied. Not through malice, but through neglect, as alternatives recede beyond reach.\r\nCynics would argue this dynamic persists today. Technological evolution races ahead, while the more modest work of sustaining trust (attention, responsiveness, adaptation) lags behind, treated as ancillary rather than foundational to the business itself.\r\nInnovation advances easily but sustaining care does not. The latter is always the first to be abandoned.\r\nIntervention and Letting Things Fail\r\nStickiness and long-term adoption work hand in hand. “It’s almost like taking a pulse.” When adoption becomes a problem, the falloff isn’t as dramatic.\r\nAt that stage, intervention is less about retraining and more about triage. Sometimes the answer is substitution: an existing function inside the AWS or Microsoft stack can replicate 80% of the value at a fraction of the cost. Sometimes the question is more blunt. “Are we just wasting money?” Omar said stridently.\r\nYet even that discipline has its exceptions. Artificial intelligence, for now, lives outside the normal rules of enterprise hygiene.\r\n“We have Copilot, Claude, GPT,” Omar notes. “And we’re using all of them, for different things.”\r\nRather than forcing standardization, firms are tolerating fragmentation. These tools are still too foundational, too fast-moving, to prematurely optimize. The goal is exposure, and efficiency comes in at a close second. Teams are encouraged to experiment broadly, to understand not just what the models can do, but how they want to be used.\r\nThis has already begun to reorder older workflows. PowerPoint, once an industry sweetheart, is falling out of fashion.\r\nMuch of the public conversation around AI focuses on replacement. In the world of fund manager operations, the emphasis is different.\r\n“For the most nuanced operators,” Omar notes, “AI doesn’t replace workflows. It forces you to change them.”\r\nThe opportunity is not in swapping out one tool for another, but in rethinking how information enters the system in the first place. That requires abandoning linear processes in favor of modular ones, assembling constellations of narrowly focused tools, rather than betting on a single, end-to-end platform.\r\nThis posture acts as a sort of counter-narrative to the one that prevails among AI romantics. Point solutions are seen as weaker business propositions by both founders and venture capitalists. In other words, the ideal product should be able to analyze, then incorporate, and then solve an entire business process.\r\nTo support this, Omar points to the emerging ecosystem of model context protocols and AI agents. These are systems that can be combined, trained, and orchestrated rather than deployed wholesale. The aspiration is not just automation, but continuity.\r\nBut an end-to-end product does have its virtues. Omar, if not forthrightly, admitted as much.\r\n“If I’m in my car in the morning,” he says, “I shouldn’t be asking for only a summary of my calendar. That’s old school. Very 2025.”\r\nThe more ambitious vision is ambient capture. A phone call ends and the substance of the conversation flows directly into the calendar, the task list, and the CRM, without manual translation.\r\nEmail and chat tools like Superhuman hint at this future, but they are still surface-level. The deeper challenge is architectural: designing systems that assume intelligence at the core, not bolted on at the edges.\r\nWhy Enterprise Tech Still Falls Short\r\nAs we wrapped up our conversation, I asked Omar about the single biggest reason enterprise technology fails inside fund managers.\r\nInitially, he resisted the premise. The familiar culprits (bad data, weak change management, misaligned incentives) are not really competitors. They are work cumulatively.\r\nStill, one tends to lead.\r\n“Weak data is number one,” he says. “Because getting clean data into a system, without AI and without strong workflows, is work people don’t want to do.”\r\nWhy would an investment professional, whose edge depends on personal heuristics and idiosyncratic views, willingly conform to a standardized schema?\r\nThis is why end-to-end enterprise solutions struggle. They promise coherence but demand significant behavioral change at the point of highest resistance. The more comprehensive the system, the more it collides with how people actually think and work.\r\nThe alternative, still aspirational but increasingly plausible, is a strong central data infrastructure paired with highly specialized tools at the edges. A stable core with flexible peripherals. Enough structure to ensure integrity, enough freedom to preserve conviction.\r\n“It’s the holy grail,” Hassan says. “Strong data underneath, niche tools on top.”\r\nWhat fails, again and again, are platforms that try to do everything. In doing so, they ask users to give up the very practices that made them effective in the first place.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9jYXNoYW5kY2FycmllZC5zdWJzdGFjay5jb20vYWN0aW9uL2Rpc2FibGVfZW1haWw_dG9rZW49ZXlKMWMyVnlYMmxrSWpvek5UVXhORE00TURjc0luQnZjM1JmYVdRaU9qRTROekl3TXpNeE15d2lhV0YwSWpveE56Y3dORGM1TWpJMUxDSmxlSEFpT2pFNE1ESXdNVFV5TWpVc0ltbHpjeUk2SW5CMVlpMHpNak0wTWpJeUlpd2ljM1ZpSWpvaVpHbHpZV0pzWlY5bGJXRnBiQ0o5LkZoM3FQQ1ZhbWhPcktpd25BRkIzRjl2dGdjUnpTcUpwb29lZVh6X2VaMDAiLCJwIjoxODcyMDMzMTMsInMiOjMyMzQyMjIsImYiOnRydWUsInUiOjM1NTE0MzgwNywiaWF0IjoxNzcwNDc5MjI1LCJleHAiOjIwODYwNTUyMjUsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0wIiwic3ViIjoibGluay1yZWRpcmVjdCJ9.yCzLyd2qnEih42Pq6tlFoxg2sKDurE3Mq0zAsp0C0_8?",

These numbers are Invoices booked (accrual) and Cash collected (cash basis).\r\nI’m including collected during the period even if it relates to prior invoices since budget is funded by cash, not invoice dates. Also, payments from Clio sync to QBO as Undeposited Funds, so they’re counted as collected even if not yet in the bank (which means regardless of deposit timing). Once deposits are cleared, bank balances will naturally align.\r\nThis month, collections were $18,341.62, slightly behind the $20.8k target (88.2%), with $2,811.99 in pending A/R affecting next month. Please refer to the attached report.\r\nI’ll include this in the monthly report—let me know your thoughts.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJocelyn Ong\r\n\r\nAccounting and Accounts Manager\r\n\r\n\r\nLevine Law\r\nBarristers & Solicitors\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

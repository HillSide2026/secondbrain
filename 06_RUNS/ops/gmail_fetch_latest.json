I understand that you are being constantly prompted to enter a token from the app to maintain your WiFi connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNormally, you do not need to constantly enter a token from the app to continue using WiFi. Once you have registered your device using the authentication code, it should have instant access without needing to re-enter the code each time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get this sorted out, please try the following steps:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Forget the network: Go to your device's WiFi settings, select the network, and choose \"Forget this Network.\" Then reconnect and enter the token one more time to establish a fresh lease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Disable \"Private WiFi Address\" (MAC Randomization): Some devices rotate their ID for privacy. If your device changes its \"identity,\" the system thinks it’s a new guest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Check date and time: Make sure your device’s date and time are set correctly, as incorrect settings can make tokens invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the steps above do not resolve the issue, please contact your local centre team at Yorkville, who will be happy to assist with troubleshooting. You can reach them by email at Toronto.Yorkville@regus.com<mailto:Toronto.Yorkville@regus.com> or by phone at +1 416 921 5000.\r\n\r\nShould there be anything further we can assist you with, then please do not hesitate to raise a query through the Help section of your online account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVitali F.\r\n\r\nAccount Helpdesk\r\n\r\niwgplc.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew!

This session breaks down what needs to be fixed before adding anything new.\r\n\r\nWe’ll cover:\r\n\r\n• why automation adds friction in real firm workflows\r\n\r\n• what needs to be clear before automating anything\r\n\r\n• how to spot hidden workflow issues early\r\n\r\nThis is not a tool demo.\r\nIt’s about how work actually moves inside small and mid sized firms.\r\n\r\n*Save your seat:*\r\nhttps://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5T8uo0dBRyKhpstRB2KrxA?utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sendgrid.com ( https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5T8uo0dBRyKhpstRB2KrxA?utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sendgrid.com )\r\n\r\nIf you want to apply this to your own firm, you can book a short walkthrough here:\r\nhttps://legalboards.com/schedule-a-call/?utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sendgrid.com ( https://legalboards.com/schedule-a-call/?utm_source=legalboards_academy&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=before_you_automate_last_call&utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sendgrid.com )\r\n\r\nSee you tomorrow,\r\n\r\nTai Miranda\r\n10 Dundas E, 10th Floor, Toronto,  M5B 2K3\r\nUnsubscribe ( http://url9249.legalboards.com/wf/unsubscribe?upn=u001.im45Xx93dyvMaYD9uP16zuznwZju5xq7vkHmqTOmoj67saR23e-2F9Tl9nRKSUFW-2B3LXDdEtZKN-2BxSyLi9tYlY3CxWv2tCif22ORjQ1G3X-2BLvbRlZcZkAxvDDuzMvB8-2FtrZVffwGoCB46lcvaNEFWqPdWGTIg-2FopkVUo36jMP3nfIgG5oRKwzlmnwXF9fCzEmUj5dQy8i5Kc15BjuJfYINcO7LkXqWYRkd7kKHmnw7r0Rr6qu7VgsaYEAvXvO10WHsa3WOuoPP46z-2Bcn41TGZUvrCm5IRqeyyIqCj3RfivDacFID3FFkJ-2BqqqbiS7B0tUV07Ch9Ef38pswSspRBHNtfuTWi3gYQS77y27bV-2BXCAWD6SNaoCixJYyQaxFIXqNDFA3foOxGaUJvKl-2BCWXOmRHxZwe6MFd7PLnOCclisGJujdhyy3uciZb3PD91M8hkRPFHdwPcCYgqaCiVgqGNcovhFyPEzPS-2F3dauplshYdJS2ZgClCEm6IIZ1cjnuP5SUaXjiqCIVWaeZxeTGGJc97d-2BNOCJ3kExr3fOfhfBi-2BDzG5aIEAjWEKu2JG-2FqyxUHP1xqytw-2B0cz2DxDr-2BWMjXY2JzmwlRZ0W-2BvzXWNmUnr9h2xRbMFRi1Q6VCbWzeNpe-2BeyAU0WnSRM2-2F9RdV9wxa5B4KkT4L7jpGPb0eMAFrbBYVQZA2dNLx9qNb-2BuD5cm-2FIXdEAWRtSE-2BuXYUM5WlXFOrww2h221GKqEo1teThinhogAVQgXFDDEJCzJIkZ3JEHSEpSyZX6m-2BSABp-2FHmCjzNVdFLbHLiGd1QLISejXZlstqi6K2ijX-2BiF2dJInqLEFGfhy-2FWyA7S-2BobdLWflZlUBw5KF28C7vtaqbOscrb-2BkfI7M8ModdlGQxmv-2FHQxr1lGBQZzYpuNKc80ITHZ4a0SmF1QM8UOUayEimEPID2ywFghaLj-2FuF7TnMHuUNIMWzEzCyiMrUz4atWT1cfdOtSUxkBwusL99sne5GF-2BkV6ZKA6pWI6nc2uNm3LtEn8dDzblBAgIPVng4hutc-2BbF6Tt0NJg-3D-3D )",

Ha. \r\n\r\nI also have been advised to change these by franchisor:\r\n\r\nCap on Operating expenses: We tried to have the increases limited to that of CPI increase.

Thanks for any advice or to just change this. I am really anxious to get a redline in front of LL…. Supposed to take possession March 1! LOL.

Seems they want us to go much further on the two clauses marked as problematic as related to CSBFP program. I asked for exact clarity on what needs to come out and have pasted response below. I feel weird striking it myself without running through you. Can you please have a look, let me know if it makes sense (no choice, it seems), then strike as part of final redline. \r\n>>>> I will then do my best to summarize all changes and share with LL. Fingers crossed, ugh. \r\n>>>> Thank you. Note from bank here:\r\n>>>>  \r\n>>>> Good morning Chris,\r\n>>>>  \r\n>>>> I hope you are well. \r\n>>>>  \r\n>>>> Thank you for your continued support throughout this process.\r\n>>>>  \r\n>>>> Regarding the lease, I wanted to discuss two specific clauses that present challenges for our agreement:\r\n>>>>  \r\n>>>> - Section 3.4 – Leasehold Improvements: The clause states, \"All Leasehold Improvements shall immediately upon installation become the absolute property of the Landlord, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances.\" The following needs to be removed: the entire section 3.4 (a, b, c, d). We need to reference the property address in the General Security Agreement, and this clause prevents us from doing so.\r\n>>>>  \r\n>>>> - Section 8.2 – No Financing by Tenant of Leasehold Improvements: The clause states, \"The Tenant shall not create any lien, mortgage, charge, conditional sale agreement or other encumbrance in respect of its Leasehold Improvements.\" Removing this clause would allow us to secure the leaseholds, which is necessary for our agreement.\r\n>>>>  \r\n>>>> You are requesting financing on the leasehold improvements, but these clauses prevent you from doing so. \r\n>>>>  \r\n>>>> Thank you for your attention to these matters. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know. I look forward to working together on this.\r\n>>>>  \r\n>>>>  \r\n>>>>  \r\n>>>> \r\n>>>> \r\n>>>> If you wish to unsubscribe from receiving commercial electronic messages from TD Bank Group, please click here <http://www.td.com/tdoptout> or go to the following web address: www.td.com/tdoptout <http://www.td.com/tdoptout>\r\n>>>> Si vous souhaitez vous désabonner des messages électroniques de nature commerciale envoyés par Groupe Banque TD veuillez cliquer ici <http://www.td.com/tddesab> ou vous rendre à l'adresse www.td.com/tddesab <http://www.td.com/tddesab>\r\n>>>> \r\n>>>> NOTICE: Confidential message which may be privileged.

If so, where are the contracts?\r\n\r\n3. Should you have the current employees sign new employment agreements? If so, what consideration should be offered (you have to give them something to get them to sign)? Keep in mind that even signing the new agreement doesn't mean they start a probationary period.\r\n\r\nFind out how long each of the employees has been there.

Медкарта хранится в шифрованном контуре, доступ к данным разграничен по ролям. По запросу вся коммуникация ведётся через доверенное лицо, а оплата возможна наличными или безналом с нейтральным назначением платежа.

Here’s where we stand:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   The tasks in GHL have been completed.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Follow-up SMS and email sequences for leads we couldn’t reach via call\r\n   have also been finalized.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   I’m proposing a follow-up sequence for “no-show” leads so we can ask\r\n   them to reschedule. To implement this, I’ll need your help confirming\r\n   whether each lead attended their appointment.\r\n\r\nYou can check/update attendance here:\r\nAppointments Page\r\n<https://login.soulpepper.com/v2/location/Rw6TfoPhzjwqlVSn6oa8/calendars/appointments?listTab=all>\r\n\r\nI’ve also updated our leads report with a new “status” column. You can\r\nleave a note indicating whether the lead showed or not, so I can start\r\nworking with implementing the No Show Follow Up / Appreciation SMS and\r\nEmail for those who showed:\r\nLeads Report\r\n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dX6oGKfubFKtlwe2yRxvkDIxLMCcYzqs/edit?gid=526320275#gid=526320275>\r\n\r\nOnce we have the appointment statuses updated, I can set up the no-show\r\nfollow-up automation / Appreciation SMS and Email for those who showed.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nGrace\r\n\r\n>\r\n",

Did you purchase the shares of the business or the assets?\r\n\r\n2. What does the sale agreement say about the current employees?\r\n\r\nFind out from the previous owner:  Did the current people that work there sign employment contracts? If so, where are the contracts?\r\n\r\n3. Should you have the current employees sign new employment agreements?

Subject to these Terms and Conditions, a promotional purchase interest rate of 9.99% will apply to new purchases (excludes any membership costs associated with optional credit card benefits and services, such as balance protection, roadside assistance, travel insurance, and similar offerings) on your account for 6 months, from the time the promotional low rate is added to your account on \r\n\r\nMarch 4, 2026 \r\n, \r\n\r\nprovided you activate the offer by \r\n\r\nFebruary 20, 2026 \r\n \r\n\r\nand your account remains open and in good standing. A confirmation email will be sent to you when your offer is activated. If you received a notice from us that your interest rates will increase due to two missed payments in a 12-month period, the interest rate of 9.99% will no longer apply and your interest rate will increase as set out in your notice. This offer may be changed or withdrawn without notice and is only valid for the account referenced in the attached offer and is not transferable. From the time the promotional purchase interest rates are added to your account, any other installment plan programs from BMO will not be applicable to your account during the period of the promotional rates.\r\n\r\n \r\n2. The promotional purchase interest rate of 9.99% for purchases is effective until August 31, 2026 \r\n. After this date, any remaining outstanding balance amounts from purchases will be charged interest at the standard annual interest rate. Please refer to your monthly statement for the interest rate applicable to your account. \r\n\r\n \r\n3. If you accept any other promotional offer prior to the expiry of your existing offer, your existing offer may be withdrawn. This does not apply to promotional balance transfer offers. \r\n\r\n \r\n4. If you make credit card product changes after the promotional purchase interest rate is added to your account, you will lose the promotional purchase interest rate of 9.99% and the standard interest rates of the new credit card product will apply to your existing balance. \r\n\r\n5. \r\nFor residents outside of Quebec, \r\nif your account has balances with different interest rates, such as purchases with a standard interest rate and purchases with a promotional interest rate, any payment that exceeds the minimum payment will be allocated proportionately to those balances according to the terms set out in the BMO Credit Card Cardholder Agreement. For example, if you have a balance of $800 in purchases at the standard interest rate and a $200 purchase balance at a promotional interest rate, 80 percent of your payment will be allocated to your purchases with standard interest rate and 20 percent will be allocated to your purchases balance with promotional interest rate.\r\n\r\nFor residents of Quebec, \r\nif your account has balances with different interest rates, such as purchases with a standard interest rate and purchases with a promotional interest rate, any payment that exceeds the minimum payment will apply first to those balances with the highest credit rate, then to other balances in decreasing order of credit rate according to the terms set out in the BMO Credit Card Cardholder Agreement. For example, if you have a balance of $800 in purchases at the standard interest rate and a balance of $200 in purchases at a promotional interest rate, and the standard interest rate is higher than the promotional interest rate, 100 percent of your payment will first be allocated to your $800\r\n purchases balance at the standard interest rate and once the $800 is paid off, any excess payments made will be allocated to your $200 purchase balance at a promotional rate.

I believed him and he did all the disclosure and discover on his end. The Supervisor was running the day to day operations and was told I needed to keep her and the staff they had. A week after we toke over we she demanded a big raise from 60k a year 5 days a week to almost 70k a year only working 4 days a week. She was holding all the information that ran the business and I was informed to take her deal and then find a way to get her out rhe door in a few months.

I have the FDD, thank you.\r\n\r\nAt a preliminary level, I have questions about how the transaction was structured, particularly in relation to the franchise agreement that was entered into and the fee that was paid. To start with, can you confirm whether a $70,000 initial franchise fee was paid, and whether you were given an explanation at the time for why the transaction was treated as a new franchise rather than a transfer or change of control?\r\n\r\nBefore I can assess whether there is a legal issue to be examined, it would be helpful to make sure I understand the situation from your perspective. In particular:\r\n\r\n  *   What concern or issue prompted you to reach out now?\r\n\r\n  *   Who was responsible for day-to-day management of the business at the time of the transaction, and how was that role described to you?\r\n\r\n  *   Were you told that any individual’s continued involvement was expected or required when the deal was completed?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is that issues involving disclosure and transaction structure are treated differently from operational or personnel disputes, and I want to be clear on the factual background.\r\n\r\nOnce I have that context, we can discuss whether there is a legal issue worth pursuing and what the appropriate next steps might be.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

Мы приезжаем круглосуточно во все районы — от Уралмаша до Академического — и запускаем персональную схему стабилизации прямо у вас дома: экспресс-оценка, титрованные капельницы через инфузомат, защита желудка, контроль сердечного ритма, настройка сна и питьевого режима. В целях конфиденциальности специалисты приезжают без медицинской символики, документы формулируются нейтрально, уведомления — «тихие», а при желании оформляется кодовый профиль. Так мы снимаем стигму и возвращаем человеку чувство контроля уже в первые часы. \r\nРазобраться лучше - <a href=\"https://narcolog-na-dom-ekaterinburg0.ru/\" / rel=\"nofollow ugc\">помощь нарколога на дому екатеринбург</a>\r\n\r\nApprove it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=approve&c=15101#wpbody-content\r\nTrash it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=trash&c=15101#wpbody-content\r\nSpam it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=spam&c=15101#wpbody-content\r\nCurrently 15,100 comments are waiting for approval.

      "body": "View this post on the web at https://edgarems.substack.com/p/project-finance-as-a-core-growth\r\n\r\nThe M&A Baseline Before the Rise of Project Finance\r\nFor decades, mergers and acquisitions has been the primary practice area through which foreign-qualified lawyers built careers in Japan. Japan’s role as a major cross-border investment destination required international law firms to maintain strong M&A benches in Tokyo, often staffed by lawyers qualified in the US, UK, Australia, and other common-law jurisdictions.\r\nWhile other practices periodically gained traction among foreign lawyers, M&A remained structurally dominant. It aligned with Japan’s inbound and outbound investment flows, required international documentation standards, and benefited from recurring transactional cycles.\r\nThat hierarchy, however, is no longer static.\r\nOutside M&A, several practice areas have seen increased demand for foreign-qualified lawyers in Tokyo. Among them, energy and infrastructure project finance stands out for both scale and durability.\r\nAfter two exceptionally busy years and with visible demand building into 2026, project finance has shifted from a complementary practice to a strategic priority. This is not only a hiring story, but a reflection of how capital deployment in Japan and the broader region is evolving.\r\nHow Large is Project Finance Hiring in Tokyo?\r\nBefore addressing the data, a caveat is necessary.\r\nTracking hiring trends in Tokyo’s energy and infrastructure legal market is inherently imperfect. Any dataset limited to lawyers currently in private practice will undercount prior cycles, as senior lawyers may have moved in-house, relocated, or exited the market altogether. Historical comparisons should therefore be read directionally rather than as precise headcount measurements.\r\nWith that limitation in mind, a clear pattern still emerges.\r\nBased on a review of foreign-qualified lawyers currently practicing energy and infrastructure project finance within Tokyo-based private practice teams, hiring has accelerated materially over the last four years, with a pronounced concentration in 2024 and 2025.\r\nBetween 2016 and 2020, annual joins were consistently in the low single digits. These hires largely reflected replacement hiring or isolated strategic additions. From 2021 onward, volumes increased meaningfully, rising to six to nine joins per year through 2022 and 2023.\r\nIn 2024, foreign-qualified project finance hiring rose again, with fourteen recored joins. A further thirteen joins have already been identified in 2025. (Refer to Graph 1)\r\nNotably, a large share of the 2024 cohort joined in the second half of the year. This suggests firms were not merely reacting to completed transactions, but hiring in anticipation of increased activity.\r\nThat interpretation reinforced by early-2026 dynamics. Despite the year only just beginning, multiple international law firms in Tokyo are actively recruiting foreign-qualified project finance lawyers across associate, counsel, and partner levels.\r\nWhat Changed Over the Past Decade?\r\nFrom 2016 to 2025, energy and infrastructure moved from a steady, long-cycle sector into a capital-heavy transition cycle. The clearest quantitative signal is the scale and speed of energy investment growth since 2020. The IEA estimates global energy investment is set to exceed USD 3 trillion in 2024, with USD 2 trillion directed to clean energy technologies and infrastructure, including renewables, grids, and storage. By 2025, BloombergNEF estimates global energy transition investment alone reached USD 2.3 trillion, up 8% YoY, with large allocations to electrified transport, renewables, and grids. In other words, the market experienced not only more projects, but more projects that were finance-intensive, cross-border, and contract-heavy, which is exactly the profile that increases demand for sophisticated project finance legal support.\r\nRegionally, Asia sits ant the center of that pipeline because the underlying infrastructure requirement remains massive and multi-decade. The Asian Development Bank estimated developing Asia would need USD 26 trillion of infrastructure investment from 2016 to 2030, or roughly USD 1.7 trillion per year, to maintain growth momentum and address infrastructure gaps. Japan links directly into that regional cycle as a sponsor and financing hub, while also building its domestic transition pipeline.\r\nMETI has framed Green Transformation as a ten-year investment agenda, stating more than JPY 150 trillion of public-private investment is required over the next decade, with JPY 20 trillion of GC Economy Transition Bonds to support it. On the project side, offshore wind moved from policy to awarded pipeline. NEDO materials describer Round 1 auctions finalized in 2021 with 1.7 GQ awarded, and Japan’s Strategic Energy Plan sets ambitions to form 10GW of projects by 2030 and 30 to 45 GW by 2040.\r\nJapan also tightened its long-term decarbonization trajectory in its UNFCC submission, targeting 60 % emissions reduction by FY2035 and 73% by FY2040 from FY2013 levels. Together, these shifts help explain why Tokyo-based firms expanded benches of foreign-qualified project finance lawyers: more capital, more cross-border structures, and more projects where international financing standards and documentation norms are decisive.\r\nRare Earth Materials and Project Finance Demand\r\nCritical minerals, including REMs, have become a further driver of project finance demand since 2020, accelerating sharply over the past year as economies outside China seek supply chain resilience.\r\nAs energy transition technologies scale, mining, processing, and refining projects are increasingly financed on standalone or structured basis rather than through corporate balance sheets. Demand for critical minerals used in clean energy technologies is expected to multiply by 2030.\r\nFor Japan-based sponsors and lenders, these projects are often overseas and involve long-term offtake arrangements, political risk mitigation, export credit agency support, and development finance participation. Structurally, they resemble classic project finance transactions rather than conventional M&A.\r\nAs a result, international project finance documentation and market-standard structures are becoming more prevalent, reinforcing demand for foreign-qualified lawyers within Tokyo-based private practice teams.\r\nWhat This Means for 2026 and Beyond\r\nEarly 2026 signals point to continued expansion rather than normalization.\r\nAs of February, multiple international law firms in Tokyo are actively seeking to add foreign-qualified E&I lawyers. Importantly, these searches are not driven by attrition. They are capacity-driven.\r\nAcross the market, firms cite similar factors. Deal pipelines are growing. Lead times for project finance mandates are lengthening. Energy transition, infrastructure, LNG transition assets, and critical minerals work increasingly overlap.\r\nThis matters because project finance hiring typically precedes deal execution. Firms build capacity ahead of bid stages, lender panel appointments, and financial close cycles. The current hiring activity therefore reflects expectations of sustained workload through 2026 and beyond, not just recent deal flow.\r\nTaken together, these dynamics suggest that project finance is no longer a niche or counter-cyclical practice within Tokyo’s foreign-qualified legal market. It is becoming a core strategic capability, increasingly comparable to M&A in headcount importance and long-term relevance.\r\nIf the previous decade was defined by cross-border corporate transactions, the next may be defined by cross-border capital deployment into assets. For foreign-qualified lawyers in Tokyo, project finance is no longer an alternative track It is rapidly becoming one of the main ones.\r\nSources\r\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA), World Energy Investment 2024\r\nhttps://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2024/overview-and-key-findings [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/e09e5301-5672-448e-8dbf-7d8619c16f5e?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nBloombergNEF, Energy Transition Investment Trends 2025\r\nhttps://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/bloombergnef-finds-global-energy-transition-investment-reached-record-2-3-trillion-in-2025-up-8-from-2024/ [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/03811a80-24a4-4095-a55f-5a7e5df9f92d?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nAsian Development Bank (ADB), Asia Infrastructure Needs: Meeting the Challenge\r\nhttps://www.adb.org/publications/asia-infrastructure-needs [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/de1e27d5-1aa8-4581-b470-7f4192b1a851?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nMinistry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Japan, Green Transformation (GX) Policy and Transition Finance\r\nhttps://www.meti.go.jp/english/policy/energy_environment/transition_finance/index.html [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/2b9e07d4-1905-4557-97f6-5ff78da6233a?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nMETI / Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE), Strategic Energy Plan\r\nhttps://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/category/others/basic_plan/ [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/7d06e556-f80e-4c30-a6b8-3278eec13085?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nNew Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Offshore Wind Auction Results (Round 1)\r\nhttps://www.nedo.go.jp/content/100949197.pdf [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/363c4f49-4f4c-4423-9041-472b9a1ba727?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nESGian, Results of Japan’s Second Offshore Wind Round\r\nhttps://esgian.com/2023/12/13/results-of-second-offshore-wind-round-in-japan-announced/ [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/3bfba165-72c3-4408-949f-8a3d75d17b24?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nWhite & Case, Japan Offshore Wind: Round 3 Results\r\nhttps://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/japan-offshore-wind-update-round-3-results [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/78e1233e-19f3-4b6c-8cb7-347363436534?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nUNFCCC, Japan’s 2035–2040 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)\r\nhttps://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-02/Japans%202035-2040%20NDC.pdf [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/de9a876b-4dfb-482a-95d1-2c1a42701ba5?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA), The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions\r\nhttps://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/7bcbabc4-9b53-492c-892b-ffd5b417992e?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZmeXByIn0.McNV8o2DlmmyS6C076LNFFfWD2xVnU1eV3nZgmD2JTU ]\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9lZGdhcmVtcy5zdWJzdGFjay5jb20vYWN0aW9uL2Rpc2FibGVfZW1haWw_dG9rZW49ZXlKMWMyVnlYMmxrSWpvek5UVXhORE00TURjc0luQnZjM1JmYVdRaU9qRTROek0yTmpVNE5Dd2lhV0YwSWpveE56Y3dOakl6TURNM0xDSmxlSEFpT2pFNE1ESXhOVGt3TXpjc0ltbHpjeUk2SW5CMVlpMDJORE0zTVRVeUlpd2ljM1ZpSWpvaVpHbHpZV0pzWlY5bGJXRnBiQ0o5LmZwS0dVMzlNbjRNVUw5eXJUQm9hMU5FMi1LeW1yT0g3SVk3SkYwVU9kUGsiLCJwIjoxODczNjY1ODQsInMiOjY0MzcxNTIsImYiOnRydWUsInUiOjM1NTE0MzgwNywiaWF0IjoxNzcwNjIzMDM3LCJleHAiOjIwODYxOTkwMzcsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0wIiwic3ViIjoibGluay1yZWRpcmVjdCJ9.qGMZo-PmtRNjH-fqPXTIIxLmzm_aSZWlDHwbOaa20Io?",

I wanted to connect regarding where things currently stand.\r\n\r\nI know Yash spoke with you and the plan was to reconnect mid February.

The Franchisor terminated the franchise agreement for the Liberty village franchise as stated in the termination notice delivered to your client. The Franchisor never agreed to act as your client's sales agent for the equipment. Rather, in an attempt to mitigate its losses, the franchisor agreed to try to coordinate the sale of the equipment between all interested parties, your client, your client's bank and either the franchisor or a designated purchaser. The Franchisor has advised that they have not received any purchase and sales agreement from your client's bank and therefore, due to such bank's security interest in the equipment, cannot proceed with any sort of sale. As the Franchisor is not acting on your client's behalf, your client can contact their bank directly to find out what is delaying the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the franchisor has not heard of any developments since our last communication in mid-December.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\n\r\n<Outlook-A black an.png>\r\n\r\n\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\nIndependent Contractor Lawyer\r\n\r\nT:  (416) 797-6426\r\n\r\nE:  janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca<mailto:janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis e-mail may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure.

The equipment is subject to a security interest held by BMO.\r\n\r\nMy client is prepared to cooperate in making the equipment available for the franchisor’s intended disposition, with the understanding that the transfer process will need to address the lender’s requirements so that title can pass cleanly.\r\n\r\nAttached is a draft Release and Waiver Agreement.

As you know, my firm acts for Kishmish Inc. (the “Franchisee”) and Yash Raj and Jyotika Luthra (the “Franchisee Principals”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter sustained operating losses and escalating costs, Kishmish has undertaken a financial and strategic review of its business viability. The review confirmed that continued operation under the existing structure is no longer feasible. My clients wish to ensure that any transition occurs in an orderly and cooperative manner that protects the brand, the premises, and all parties’ interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, and without prejudice to any of Kishmish’s legal or statutory rights, we are instructed to open a dialogue with you to structure a mutual termination and surrender process on the following framework:\r\n\r\n  1.  Orderly Transition – Kishmish will coordinate a prompt wind-down of operations, return of keys, turnover of the premises and equipment in good order, and transfer of employees on a schedule acceptable to Nani’s.\r\n  2.  Orderly Surrender – Upon delivery of vacant possession, Nani’s will accept surrender of the sublease and franchise location in satisfaction of Kishmish’s remaining obligations.\r\n  3.  Mutual Release – The parties will execute a mutual release confirming that no further claims will be made by either party, other than those that may be expressly provided in the release and waiver documentation.\r\n  4.  Brand Protection and Confidentiality – Kishmish will return all confidential materials and intellectual-property assets in accordance with the franchise agreement. It will enter into a confidentiality agreement on mutually acceptable terms.\r\n\r\nKishmish continues to operate in good faith pending these discussions and is prepared to cooperate fully in a controlled handover that minimizes disruption.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm a convenient time to discuss. We would appreciate receiving your acknowledgement so that we can promptly coordinate next steps.\r\n\r\nAll of our client’s statutory, contractual, and equitable rights are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\n\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

I wanted to connect regarding where things currently stand.\r\n\r\nI know Yash spoke with you and the plan was to reconnect mid February.

The Franchisor terminated the franchise agreement for the Liberty village franchise as stated in the termination notice delivered to your client. The Franchisor never agreed to act as your client's sales agent for the equipment. Rather, in an attempt to mitigate its losses, the franchisor agreed to try to coordinate the sale of the equipment between all interested parties, your client, your client's bank and either the franchisor or a designated purchaser. The Franchisor has advised that they have not received any purchase and sales agreement from your client's bank and therefore, due to such bank's security interest in the equipment, cannot proceed with any sort of sale. As the Franchisor is not acting on your client's behalf, your client can contact their bank directly to find out what is delaying the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the franchisor has not heard of any developments since our last communication in mid-December.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\n\r\n<Outlook-A black an.png>\r\n\r\n\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\nIndependent Contractor Lawyer\r\n\r\nT:  (416) 797-6426\r\n\r\nE:  janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca<mailto:janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis e-mail may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure.

As you know, my firm acts for Kishmish Inc. (the “Franchisee”) and Yash Raj and Jyotika Luthra (the “Franchisee Principals”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter sustained operating losses and escalating costs, Kishmish has undertaken a financial and strategic review of its business viability. The review confirmed that continued operation under the existing structure is no longer feasible. My clients wish to ensure that any transition occurs in an orderly and cooperative manner that protects the brand, the premises, and all parties’ interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, and without prejudice to any of Kishmish’s legal or statutory rights, we are instructed to open a dialogue with you to structure a mutual termination and surrender process on the following framework:\r\n\r\n  1.  Orderly Transition – Kishmish will coordinate a prompt wind-down of operations, return of keys, turnover of the premises and equipment in good order, and transfer of employees on a schedule acceptable to Nani’s.\r\n  2.  Orderly Surrender – Upon delivery of vacant possession, Nani’s will accept surrender of the sublease and franchise location in satisfaction of Kishmish’s remaining obligations.\r\n  3.  Mutual Release – The parties will execute a mutual release confirming that no further claims will be made by either party, other than those that may be expressly provided in the release and waiver documentation.\r\n  4.  Brand Protection and Confidentiality – Kishmish will return all confidential materials and intellectual-property assets in accordance with the franchise agreement. It will enter into a confidentiality agreement on mutually acceptable terms.\r\n\r\nKishmish continues to operate in good faith pending these discussions and is prepared to cooperate fully in a controlled handover that minimizes disruption.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm a convenient time to discuss. We would appreciate receiving your acknowledgement so that we can promptly coordinate next steps.\r\n\r\nAll of our client’s statutory, contractual, and equitable rights are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\n\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

I wanted to connect regarding where things currently stand.\r\n\r\nI know Yash spoke with you and the plan was to reconnect mid February. At this point, several pieces remain up in the air—particularly following our last communication with the bank, where there is still no clear direction on the status of the equipment.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this ongoing uncertainty has left us in a more difficult financial position. While we are very grateful for the flexibility provided through the payment plan, we are not currently in a position to make the final installment owed. Based on the invoices we’ve received, I do believe we are otherwise up to date on payments to date.\r\n\r\nGiven the circumstances, we would like to respectfully request to cease our retainer at this time and, if possible, not proceed with the final payment. This is not a reflection of your efforts, but rather our current financial constraints and the lack of forward momentum we are able to act on.\r\n\r\nShould our situation change and we find ourselves in a position to move forward meaningfully, would it be acceptable for us to reach out to you again at that time to potentially resume services?\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and support, and we appreciate your understanding.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nJyotika Luthra\r\n+1 647 673 0412\r\n\r\nExcuse any typos or errors.

The Franchisor terminated the franchise agreement for the Liberty village franchise as stated in the termination notice delivered to your client. The Franchisor never agreed to act as your client's sales agent for the equipment. Rather, in an attempt to mitigate its losses, the franchisor agreed to try to coordinate the sale of the equipment between all interested parties, your client, your client's bank and either the franchisor or a designated purchaser. The Franchisor has advised that they have not received any purchase and sales agreement from your client's bank and therefore, due to such bank's security interest in the equipment, cannot proceed with any sort of sale. As the Franchisor is not acting on your client's behalf, your client can contact their bank directly to find out what is delaying the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the franchisor has not heard of any developments since our last communication in mid-December.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\n\r\n<Outlook-A black an.png>\r\n\r\n\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\nIndependent Contractor Lawyer\r\n\r\nT:  (416) 797-6426\r\n\r\nE:  janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca<mailto:janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis e-mail may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure.

As you know, my firm acts for Kishmish Inc. (the “Franchisee”) and Yash Raj and Jyotika Luthra (the “Franchisee Principals”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter sustained operating losses and escalating costs, Kishmish has undertaken a financial and strategic review of its business viability. The review confirmed that continued operation under the existing structure is no longer feasible. My clients wish to ensure that any transition occurs in an orderly and cooperative manner that protects the brand, the premises, and all parties’ interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, and without prejudice to any of Kishmish’s legal or statutory rights, we are instructed to open a dialogue with you to structure a mutual termination and surrender process on the following framework:\r\n\r\n  1.  Orderly Transition – Kishmish will coordinate a prompt wind-down of operations, return of keys, turnover of the premises and equipment in good order, and transfer of employees on a schedule acceptable to Nani’s.\r\n  2.  Orderly Surrender – Upon delivery of vacant possession, Nani’s will accept surrender of the sublease and franchise location in satisfaction of Kishmish’s remaining obligations.\r\n  3.  Mutual Release – The parties will execute a mutual release confirming that no further claims will be made by either party, other than those that may be expressly provided in the release and waiver documentation.\r\n  4.  Brand Protection and Confidentiality – Kishmish will return all confidential materials and intellectual-property assets in accordance with the franchise agreement. It will enter into a confidentiality agreement on mutually acceptable terms.\r\n\r\nKishmish continues to operate in good faith pending these discussions and is prepared to cooperate fully in a controlled handover that minimizes disruption.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm a convenient time to discuss. We would appreciate receiving your acknowledgement so that we can promptly coordinate next steps.\r\n\r\nAll of our client’s statutory, contractual, and equitable rights are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\n\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

I wanted to connect regarding where things currently stand.\r\n\r\nI know Yash spoke with you and the plan was to reconnect mid February. At this point, several pieces remain up in the air—particularly following our last communication with the bank, where there is still no clear direction on the status of the equipment.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this ongoing uncertainty has left us in a more difficult financial position. While we are very grateful for the flexibility provided through the payment plan, we are not currently in a position to make the final installment owed. Based on the invoices we’ve received, I do believe we are otherwise up to date on payments to date.\r\n\r\nGiven the circumstances, we would like to respectfully request to cease our retainer at this time and, if possible, not proceed with the final payment. This is not a reflection of your efforts, but rather our current financial constraints and the lack of forward momentum we are able to act on.\r\n\r\nShould our situation change and we find ourselves in a position to move forward meaningfully, would it be acceptable for us to reach out to you again at that time to potentially resume services?\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and support, and we appreciate your understanding.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nJyotika Luthra\r\n+1 647 673 0412\r\n\r\nExcuse any typos or errors.

The Franchisor terminated the franchise agreement for the Liberty village franchise as stated in the termination notice delivered to your client. The Franchisor never agreed to act as your client's sales agent for the equipment. Rather, in an attempt to mitigate its losses, the franchisor agreed to try to coordinate the sale of the equipment between all interested parties, your client, your client's bank and either the franchisor or a designated purchaser. The Franchisor has advised that they have not received any purchase and sales agreement from your client's bank and therefore, due to such bank's security interest in the equipment, cannot proceed with any sort of sale. As the Franchisor is not acting on your client's behalf, your client can contact their bank directly to find out what is delaying the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the franchisor has not heard of any developments since our last communication in mid-December.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\n\r\n<Outlook-A black an.png>\r\n\r\n\r\nJanet Erskine\r\n\r\nIndependent Contractor Lawyer\r\n\r\nT:  (416) 797-6426\r\n\r\nE:  janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca<mailto:janet.erskine@ship-law-adr.ca>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis e-mail may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure.

As you know, my firm acts for Kishmish Inc. (the “Franchisee”) and Yash Raj and Jyotika Luthra (the “Franchisee Principals”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter sustained operating losses and escalating costs, Kishmish has undertaken a financial and strategic review of its business viability. The review confirmed that continued operation under the existing structure is no longer feasible. My clients wish to ensure that any transition occurs in an orderly and cooperative manner that protects the brand, the premises, and all parties’ interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, and without prejudice to any of Kishmish’s legal or statutory rights, we are instructed to open a dialogue with you to structure a mutual termination and surrender process on the following framework:\r\n\r\n  1.  Orderly Transition – Kishmish will coordinate a prompt wind-down of operations, return of keys, turnover of the premises and equipment in good order, and transfer of employees on a schedule acceptable to Nani’s.\r\n  2.  Orderly Surrender – Upon delivery of vacant possession, Nani’s will accept surrender of the sublease and franchise location in satisfaction of Kishmish’s remaining obligations.\r\n  3.  Mutual Release – The parties will execute a mutual release confirming that no further claims will be made by either party, other than those that may be expressly provided in the release and waiver documentation.\r\n  4.  Brand Protection and Confidentiality – Kishmish will return all confidential materials and intellectual-property assets in accordance with the franchise agreement. It will enter into a confidentiality agreement on mutually acceptable terms.\r\n\r\nKishmish continues to operate in good faith pending these discussions and is prepared to cooperate fully in a controlled handover that minimizes disruption.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm a convenient time to discuss. We would appreciate receiving your acknowledgement so that we can promptly coordinate next steps.\r\n\r\nAll of our client’s statutory, contractual, and equitable rights are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\n\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

Orderly Surrender – Upon delivery of vacant possession, Nani’s will\r\n>    accept surrender of the sublease and franchise location in satisfaction of\r\n>    Kishmish’s remaining obligations.\r\n>    3. Mutual Release – The parties will execute a mutual release\r\n>    confirming that no further claims will be made by either party, other than\r\n>    those that may be expressly provided in the release and waiver\r\n>    documentation.\r\n>    4.

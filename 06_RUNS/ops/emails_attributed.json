Using unique identifiers as <strong>business reference numbers</strong> is a simple and reliable approach that avoids complex logic. With the right configuration, <strong>item IDs</strong> can become meaningful identifiers users recognize and trust.</p>\n<p data-start=\"526\" data-end=\"856\">Ultimate Forms makes it easy to generate user-friendly reference numbers. These can appear on forms, views, <strong>emails</strong>, and <strong>printed documents</strong>. You can format, prefix, and display these IDs consistently without custom code or external automation. This helps teams standardize how records are referenced across processes.</p>\n<p data-start=\"858\" data-end=\"1194\">This approach works especially well for real-world scenarios like <strong>service requests</strong>, <strong>help desk tickets</strong>, <strong>purchase orders</strong>, and approvals. Users immediately see a clear reference number they can quote in conversations and emails. At the same time, administrators benefit from a fast, low-maintenance solution built directly into SharePoint.</p>\n <a href=\"https://email.infowisesolutions.com/c/eJxsyjuOwyAQANDTQIcFA2FCQbE_7oFhEiNhiAyOr7_afuv3stc5aUycvEKU2mmHyDePtIKkrF2MTt3u2Rjl8v3mSKGDbBIvHiRYCdIqK63CRS0rA9Q3HcyXtfpbfgbzYxggM7K0R7_KoNHrOUtvY0l959Vvc74G0x8MAoNwXdfy72QQ1tqfDMI5SnuKscWDXr20KcqkXZQ8RBxi_VMaQxz0oINaItHOfaVj8N0jSiMNGn74Pc650cWMrPQujSo9Y11S5G8PvwEAAP__gjZWBw\">Read more in our blog</a><br/><br/>\n                                        </p>\n                                       \n<hr/>\n                                        <p>\n                                            From 2005 and onwards, <b>Infowise</b> has been a leading provider of forms and automation for Microsoft SharePoint.\n</p><p>\nOur <b>Ultimate Forms</b> is a all-in-one platform that enables everyone to easily create business solutions in SharePoint without a single line of code, on premises and in the cloud.\n                                        </p>\n<hr/>\n <div style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"mailto:sales@infowisesolutions.com\">Contact Us</a> | <a href=\"https://email.infowisesolutions.com/c/eJxsyk1yhSAMAODTwJIJIZLngkX_uAdiqMygvnlSmd6-F-j-W4Nbs-OsJVhmcLObmfUWUprmKRdCkEWyh8c0P0qxsCxlpSRW14CAHhC89eAtG2sWhewmF-nDe_cJ75G-SCErgnqUc9RLrrP99Hoel8nnrlvYen9eyr0pjArjGMP8KxXG56veKf_qPTADATHpV9hT75sMRdDkroc0-U7N5KTvgH8BAAD_\n[TRUNCATED]",

I have the FDD, thank you.\r\n\r\nAt a preliminary level, I have questions about how the transaction was structured, particularly in relation to the franchise agreement that was entered into and the fee that was paid. To start with, can you confirm whether a $70,000 initial franchise fee was paid, and whether you were given an explanation at the time for why the transaction was treated as a new franchise rather than a transfer or change of control?\r\n\r\nBefore I can assess whether there is a legal issue to be examined, it would be helpful to make sure I understand the situation from your perspective. In particular:\r\n\r\n  *   What concern or issue prompted you to reach out now?\r\n\r\n  *   Who was responsible for day-to-day management of the business at the time of the transaction, and how was that role described to you?\r\n\r\n  *   Were you told that any individual’s continued involvement was expected or required when the deal was completed?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is that issues involving disclosure and transaction structure are treated differently from operational or personnel disputes, and I want to be clear on the factual background.\r\n\r\nOnce I have that context, we can discuss whether there is a legal issue worth pursuing and what the appropriate next steps might be.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

While we where looking for a site his Growing minds became for sale and the owner of the franchise said it would be good to take Growing minds and change it to Uptown Montessori under the franchise name. I believed him and he did all the disclosure and discover on his end. The Supervisor was running the day to day operations and was told I needed to keep her and the staff they had. A week after we toke over we she demanded a big raise from 60k a year 5 days a week to almost 70k a year only working 4 days a week. She was holding all the information that ran the business and I was informed to take her deal and then find a way to get her out rhe door in a few months. Right now I do not feel welcome their and I do not want to even show up.

I have the FDD, thank you.\r\n\r\nAt a preliminary level, I have questions about how the transaction was structured, particularly in relation to the franchise agreement that was entered into and the fee that was paid. To start with, can you confirm whether a $70,000 initial franchise fee was paid, and whether you were given an explanation at the time for why the transaction was treated as a new franchise rather than a transfer or change of control?\r\n\r\nBefore I can assess whether there is a legal issue to be examined, it would be helpful to make sure I understand the situation from your perspective. In particular:\r\n\r\n  *   What concern or issue prompted you to reach out now?\r\n\r\n  *   Who was responsible for day-to-day management of the business at the time of the transaction, and how was that role described to you?\r\n\r\n  *   Were you told that any individual’s continued involvement was expected or required when the deal was completed?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is that issues involving disclosure and transaction structure are treated differently from operational or personnel disputes, and I want to be clear on the factual background.\r\n\r\nOnce I have that context, we can discuss whether there is a legal issue worth pursuing and what the appropriate next steps might be.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

Thank you again for your message, I really appreciate the transparency.\r\nI completely understand, and I’m very glad to hear that you’d like to find a way for us to work together.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to emphasize that I would be very happy to get started right away with whatever hours you have available initially. My main priority is the opportunity to begin working with you, learn the practice, and contribute as things ramp up.\r\n\r\nYour suggestion to touch base again in a couple of weeks makes perfect sense, and once the joint venture is finalized and workflow becomes clearer, we can certainly revisit what a more consistent weekly structure might look like at that time.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to mention that I’m currently in touch with a few individuals and business contacts who may be seeking legal support in the near term, and I would be very happy to explore opportunities to bring additional work into the firm as we get started.\r\n\r\nWhenever you have a moment, I’d be happy to connect briefly by phone, but I’m also very comfortable moving forward by email if easier.\r\n\r\nThank you again. I’m very excited about the possibility of working together.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nLaura Hinton",

We need to reference the property address in the General Security Agreement, and this clause prevents us from doing so.\r\n> \r\n> - Section 8.2 – No Financing by Tenant of Leasehold Improvements: The clause states, \"The Tenant shall not create any lien, mortgage, charge, conditional sale agreement or other encumbrance in respect of its Leasehold Improvements.\" Removing this clause would allow us to secure the leaseholds, which is necessary for our agreement.\r\n> \r\n> You are requesting financing on the leasehold improvements, but these clauses prevent you from doing so. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your attention to these matters.

      "body": "Hi Matthew-\r\nAs mentioned, I sent lease to lender (TD) for final review before sharing with LL. Seems they want us to go much further on the two clauses marked as problematic as related to CSBFP program. I asked for exact clarity on what needs to come out and have pasted response below. I feel weird striking it myself without running through you. Can you please have a look, let me know if it makes sense (no choice, it seems), then strike as part of final redline. \r\nI will then do my best to summarize all changes and share with LL. Fingers crossed, ugh. Stressful!\r\nThank you. Note from bank here:\r\n\r\nGood morning Chris,\r\n\r\nI hope you are well. \r\n\r\nThank you for your continued support throughout this process.\r\n\r\nRegarding the lease, I wanted to discuss two specific clauses that present challenges for our agreement:\r\n\r\n- Section 3.4 – Leasehold Improvements: The clause states, \"All Leasehold Improvements shall immediately upon installation become the absolute property of the Landlord, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances.\" The following needs to be removed: the entire section 3.4 (a, b, c, d). We need to reference the property address in the General Security Agreement, and this clause prevents us from doing so.\r\n\r\n- Section 8.2 – No Financing by Tenant of Leasehold Improvements: The clause states, \"The Tenant shall not create any lien, mortgage, charge, conditional sale agreement or other encumbrance in respect of its Leasehold Improvements.\" Removing this clause would allow us to secure the leaseholds, which is necessary for our agreement.\r\n\r\nYou are requesting financing on the leasehold improvements, but these clauses prevent you from doing so. \r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to these matters. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know. I look forward to working together on this.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n \r\nTisanth Thanabalasingam\r\nRemote Account Manager, Small Business (Remote Strategy) | TD  Business Banking \r\n\r\n> On Jan 30, 2026, at 4:33 PM, Matthew Levine <matthew@levinelegal.ca> wrote:\r\n> \r\n> Hi Chris\r\n> \r\n> Attached is consolidated redline and clean copy.

The sales agreement has a number of relevant provisions. Your friend is right that asking for the employment contracts is one specific next step.\r\n\r\nI'm obligated to say that the above is not legal advice. I cannot provide legal advice or act as your business' lawyer until there is an agreement between us.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

Did you purchase the shares of the business or the assets?\r\n\r\n2. What does the sale agreement say about the current employees?\r\n\r\nFind out from the previous owner:  Did the current people that work there sign employment contracts? If so, where are the contracts?\r\n\r\n3. Should you have the current employees sign new employment agreements? If so, what consideration should be offered (you have to give them something to get them to sign)? Keep in mind that even signing the new agreement doesn't mean they start a probationary period.\r\n\r\nFind out how long each of the employees has been there. That will tell you what kind of severance you will be responsible for if you decide to terminate them.\r\n\r\nKristi\r\n\r\n--\r\n[Flagship Software Logo]        Kristi Kanitz\r\nGeneral Manager\r\n\r\nKristi@flagshipsoftware.com <mailto:Kristi@flagshipsoftware.com>\r\nwww.flagshipsoftware.com <https://www.flagshipsoftware.com/>\r\n\r\n416‑410‑6357 / 1‑866‑672‑0007 ext 102\r\n",

A week after we toke over we she demanded a big raise from 60k a year 5 days a week to almost 70k a year only working 4 days a week.

I have the FDD, thank you.\r\n\r\nAt a preliminary level, I have questions about how the transaction was structured, particularly in relation to the franchise agreement that was entered into and the fee that was paid. To start with, can you confirm whether a $70,000 initial franchise fee was paid, and whether you were given an explanation at the time for why the transaction was treated as a new franchise rather than a transfer or change of control?\r\n\r\nBefore I can assess whether there is a legal issue to be examined, it would be helpful to make sure I understand the situation from your perspective. In particular:\r\n\r\n  *   What concern or issue prompted you to reach out now?\r\n\r\n  *   Who was responsible for day-to-day management of the business at the time of the transaction, and how was that role described to you?\r\n\r\n  *   Were you told that any individual’s continued involvement was expected or required when the deal was completed?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is that issues involving disclosure and transaction structure are treated differently from operational or personnel disputes, and I want to be clear on the factual background.\r\n\r\nOnce I have that context, we can discuss whether there is a legal issue worth pursuing and what the appropriate next steps might be.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

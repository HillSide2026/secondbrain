## Quality Checklist

| File | Frontmatter | Sections | Links | Placement | Overall |
|------|-------------|----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| new_playbook.md | ❌ | ✓ | N/A | ✓ | FAIL |
| modified_runbook.md | ✓ | ✓ | N/A | ✓ | PASS |
| wrong_folder_doc.md | Partial | ✓ | N/A | ❌ | FAIL |

## Recommendations

1. **new_playbook.md**: Add required YAML frontmatter
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: [Playbook Title]
   status: draft
   author: [Author]
   last_updated: 2026-01-27
   ---
   ```

2. **wrong_folder_doc.md**: Escalate to SYS-005
   - Content appears to be binding doctrine
   - Placement decision required from System Governance
   - Do NOT merge until placement resolved

3. **PR Merge Decision**:
   - Block merge until all files pass validation
   - Remediation required for 2 files
   - Re-run QA check after fixes applied

---

## Actions

- [ ] Request frontmatter addition for new_playbook.md
- [ ] Handoff wrong_folder_doc.md to SYS-005 for governance review
- [ ] Re-validate PR changeset after remediation
- [ ] Approve PR only when all files pass

---

## Evidence

- 03_TESTS/fixtures/pr_changeset/new_playbook.md:1 — Starts with `# New Playbook` (no `---` block)
- 03_TESTS/fixtures/pr_changeset/modified_runbook.md:1-6 — Valid YAML frontmatter present
- 03_TESTS/fixtures/pr_changeset/wrong_folder_doc.md:1 — Contains "Binding Policy" header
- 03_TESTS/golden_outputs/qa_validation_report.md — Reference golden output
- 00_SYSTEM/SCHEMAS.md — Schema reference (if exists)

---

## Assumptions / Confidence

- High confidence: Frontmatter detection based on presence of `---` block at file start
- High confidence: Content type classification based on "BINDING" and "Policy" keywords
- Medium confidence: Placement rules inferred from content type
- Assumed: Test fixtures accurately represent production scenarios
- Note: This is a test run; no actual PR blocked

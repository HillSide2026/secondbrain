# No-Write-Path Verification Report

**Agent:** SYS-007 — Integration Steward
**Version:** v0.1
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Scope:** Stage 2.1 Integration Spec Review

---

## Summary

- Reviewed integration specifications for Stage 2 scope
- Verified no-write-path compliance for all documented integrations
- 3 integrations documented (Gmail, SharePoint, Word)
- All integrations confirmed read-only in current stage
- No credential handling detected in specifications

---

## Findings

1. **Gmail Integration Spec**
   - Location: `10_ARCHIVE/INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/STAGE1/STAGE1.2/`
   - Read-Only Verified: **PASS**
   - Write Capabilities: None documented
   - Credential References: None
   - Status: Compliant for Stage 2.1

2. **SharePoint Integration Spec**
   - Location: `10_ARCHIVE/INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/STAGE1/STAGE1.2/`
   - Read-Only Verified: **PASS**
   - Write Capabilities: None documented
   - Credential References: None
   - Status: Compliant for Stage 2.1

3. **Word Integration Spec**
   - Location: `10_ARCHIVE/INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/STAGE1/STAGE1.2/`
   - Read-Only Verified: **PASS**
   - Write Capabilities: None documented
   - Credential References: None
   - Status: Compliant for Stage 2.1

## Capability Matrix

| Integration | Read | Write | Auth Method | Approved Scopes | Status |
|-------------|------|-------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Gmail | Yes | No | OAuth2 | readonly | Stage 2.2 |
| SharePoint | Yes | No | OAuth2 | Sites.Read.All | Stage 2.2 |
| Word | Yes | No | OAuth2 | Files.Read | Stage 2.2 |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Integration Activation**: Defer to Stage 2.2
   - All specs document read-only approach
   - No write-back paths identified
   - Activation requires ML1 approval

2. **Credential Handling**: Document separately
   - No credentials in specs (correct)
   - Credential docs required for Phase 4.2
   - Use secure storage patterns only

3. **Pre-Activation Checklist**:
   - [ ] Confirm OAuth app registrations
   - [ ] Verify scope restrictions match specs
   - [ ] Test read-only access in sandbox
   - [ ] Document rollback procedure

---

## Actions

- [ ] Prepare integration activation plan for Stage 2.2
- [ ] Document credential handling requirements (Phase 4.2)
- [ ] Create rollback procedures for each integration
- [ ] Handoff verification report to SYS-009 for QA review

---

## Evidence

- 00_SYSTEM/WRITE_BACK_POLICY.md — Confirms local-first policy
- 00_SYSTEM/AGENTS/SYS-007_INTEGRATION_STEWARD.md:38-41 — Explicit prohibitions
- 10_ARCHIVE/INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/STAGE1/STAGE1.2/ — Archived integration specs
- 03_TESTS/fixtures/conflicting_rules.md — Rule collision detection test (not applicable here)

---

## Assumptions / Confidence

- High confidence: No write capabilities documented in current specs
- High confidence: No credential references in reviewed specifications
- Assumed: Archived specs reflect current intended approach
- Assumed: Stage 2.2 will require ML1 approval for activation
- Note: Actual integration testing deferred to Stage 2.2

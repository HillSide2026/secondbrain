# Phase 3.3 — End-to-End Test Results

**Test Date:** 2026-01-27
**Scope:** Weekly cycle simulation (dry run)

---

## Summary

- Simulated complete weekly cycle with all 5 agents
- All agents produced compliant outputs
- Standard output format verified across all outputs
- No gaps or failures identified

---

## Weekly Cycle Simulation

### Cycle Context
- **Week:** 2026-W05 (simulated)
- **Agents:** SYS-005, SYS-006, SYS-007, SYS-008, SYS-009
- **Mode:** Dry run (no external integrations)

---

## Step 1: INBOX Scan (SYS-008 Knowledge Curation)

**Trigger:** Weekly cycle start
**Input:** `09_INBOX/` contents (simulated via test fixtures)
**Output:** INBOX Triage Report

### Results

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| INBOX scanned | PASS | Test fixtures used |
| Misplaced artifacts detected | PASS | FIXTURE-001 flagged |
| Stale artifacts detected | PASS | FIXTURE-002 flagged |
| Standard output format | PASS | All sections present |
| Promotion proposals generated | PASS | With rationale |

**Evidence:** [SYS-008_TEST_OUTPUT.md](03_TESTS/agent_outputs/SYS-008_TEST_OUTPUT.md)

---

## Step 2: Backlog Update (SYS-006 Portfolio Planning)

**Trigger:** After INBOX scan
**Input:** Current backlog, stage artifacts
**Output:** Backlog Prioritization Report

### Results

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Backlog reviewed | PASS | 11 items analyzed |
| Priorities assigned | PASS | P1/P2 classification |
| Stage closure readiness assessed | PASS | Stage 2.1 DoD checked |
| Standard output format | PASS | All sections present |
| Sequencing proposals generated | PASS | With dependencies |

**Evidence:** [SYS-006_TEST_OUTPUT.md](03_TESTS/agent_outputs/SYS-006_TEST_OUTPUT.md)

---

## Step 3: Compliance Check (SYS-005 System Governance)

**Trigger:** After backlog update
**Input:** PR changeset (test fixture), governance rules
**Output:** Governance Compliance Report

### Results

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| PR changeset reviewed | PASS | 3 files analyzed |
| Folder placement validated | PASS | 1 violation detected |
| Schema compliance checked | PASS | 1 failure detected |
| Standard output format | PASS | All sections present |
| Remediation actions listed | PASS | Clear next steps |

**Evidence:** [SYS-005_TEST_OUTPUT.md](03_TESTS/agent_outputs/SYS-005_TEST_OUTPUT.md)

---

## Step 4: Integration Review (SYS-007 Integration Steward)

**Trigger:** After compliance check
**Input:** Integration specs (archived)
**Output:** No-Write-Path Verification Report

### Results

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Integration specs reviewed | PASS | 3 integrations |
| No-write-path verified | PASS | All read-only |
| Capability matrix generated | PASS | With auth methods |
| Standard output format | PASS | All sections present |
| Handoff to QA prepared | PASS | Summary included |

**Evidence:** [SYS-007_TEST_OUTPUT.md](03_TESTS/agent_outputs/SYS-007_TEST_OUTPUT.md)

---

## Step 5: QA Validation (SYS-009 Runbook & QA)

**Trigger:** After integration review
**Input:** PR changeset (test fixture), schemas
**Output:** QA Validation Report

### Results

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Schema validation performed | PASS | Frontmatter checked |
| Content review completed | PASS | Required sections verified |
| Issues documented | PASS | 2 files flagged |
| Standard output format | PASS | All sections present |
| Remediation suggestions provided | PASS | With templates |

**Evidence:** [SYS-009_TEST_OUTPUT.md](03_TESTS/agent_outputs/SYS-009_TEST_OUTPUT.md)

## Output Format Compliance

| Agent | Summary | Findings | Recommendations | Actions | Evidence | Assumptions |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| SYS-005 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| SYS-006 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| SYS-007 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| SYS-008 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| SYS-009 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Result:** All agents conform to standard output format.

---

## Findings

1. **Weekly cycle simulation successful**
   - All 5 agents produced outputs
   - Handoffs between agents validated
   - No manual intervention required

2. **Standard output format enables automation**
   - Consistent structure across all outputs
   - Machine-readable sections
   - Evidence traceable to source files

3. **Test fixtures effective**
   - Misplaced/stale artifacts detected correctly
   - PR changeset validation worked
   - Rule collision scenario available for future testing

---

## Recommendations

1. **Ready for production weekly cycle**
   - All agents functional
   - Handoffs validated
   - Output format compliant

2. **Add scheduling mechanism**
   - Automate weekly trigger
   - Consider cron job or GitHub Actions

3. **Monitor first production cycle closely**
   - Verify outputs match test expectations
   - Document any deviations

---

## Actions

- [x] Simulate INBOX scan (SYS-008)
- [x] Simulate backlog update (SYS-006)
- [x] Simulate compliance check (SYS-005)
- [x] Simulate integration review (SYS-007)
- [x] Simulate QA validation (SYS-009)
- [x] Verify standard output format compliance
- [x] Document results and gaps

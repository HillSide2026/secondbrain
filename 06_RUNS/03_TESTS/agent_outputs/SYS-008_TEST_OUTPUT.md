# Inbox Triage Report

**Agent:** SYS-008 — Knowledge Curation
**Version:** v0.1
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Scope:** Test Fixture Validation (FIXTURE-001, FIXTURE-002)

---

## Summary

- Scanned 2 test fixtures for triage validation
- 1 misplaced artifact detected (FIXTURE-001)
- 1 stale artifact detected (FIXTURE-002)
- No deletions or moves executed (simulation only)
- All findings require ML1 review before action

---

## Findings

1. **FIXTURE-001: Misplaced Artifact**
   - Status: **MISPLACED**
   - Current Location: `04_INITIATIVES/` (simulated)
   - Correct Location: `01_DOCTRINE/01_BINDING/`
   - Content Type: Binding doctrine (Status: BINDING, Authority: ML1)
   - Detection Method: Keyword analysis ("BINDING", "Authority")
   - Action Required: Propose move to correct folder

2. **FIXTURE-002: Stale Artifact**
   - Status: **STALE**
   - Last Modified: 2025-09-29
   - Days Since Update: 120 days
   - Staleness Threshold: 90 days
   - Content Type: Integration notes (legacy system)
   - Detection Method: Timestamp comparison
   - Action Required: Flag for review (archive or refresh)

---

## Recommendations

1. **Misplaced Artifact (FIXTURE-001)**:
   - Move to `01_DOCTRINE/01_BINDING/`
   - Rename to follow doctrine naming convention: `DOCTRINE-2026-XXX-*.md`
   - Requires ML1 approval (doctrine promotion)
   - Handoff to SYS-005 for governance validation

2. **Stale Artifact (FIXTURE-002)**:
   - Flag for content review
   - Options:
     - **Archive**: Move to `10_ARCHIVE/` if no longer relevant
     - **Refresh**: Update content and reset timestamp
     - **Deprecate**: Mark as deprecated but retain for reference
   - Do NOT delete without explicit ML1 approval

3. **General Process**:
   - Run staleness check weekly
   - Triage INBOX items within 7 days of arrival
   - Coordinate with SYS-005 on placement decisions

---

## Actions

- [ ] Propose move for misplaced artifact to SYS-005
- [ ] Flag stale artifact for ML1 review
- [ ] Update triage tracking (if applicable)
- [ ] Re-scan after remediation

---

## Evidence

- 03_TESTS/fixtures/misplaced_artifact.md:35-42 — Contains "BINDING" and "Authority: ML1"
- 03_TESTS/fixtures/stale_artifact.md:14 — Last Updated: 2025-09-29 (120 days ago)
- 00_SYSTEM/FOLDER_MAP.md — Folder placement rules (reference)
- 00_SYSTEM/AGENTS/SYS-008_KNOWLEDGE_CURATION.md — Staleness threshold (90 days)

---

## Assumptions / Confidence

- High confidence: Misplacement detection based on content keywords
- High confidence: Staleness detection based on documented last-modified date
- Assumed: Simulated dates in test fixtures are accurate
- Assumed: 90-day staleness threshold is authoritative
- Note: This is a test run; no actual files moved or archived

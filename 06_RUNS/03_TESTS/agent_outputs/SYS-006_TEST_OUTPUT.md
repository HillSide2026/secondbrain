# Backlog Prioritization Report

**Agent:** SYS-006 — Portfolio Planning
**Version:** v0.1
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Scope:** System Portfolio Backlog Review

---

## Summary

- Reviewed 11 backlog items across Stage 2 phases
- 1 item resolved (SYS-001 Agent Runtime Selection)
- 5 items in Stage 2.1 scope (SYS-005 to SYS-009)
- 3 items in Stage 2.2 scope (SYS-002 to SYS-004)
- 2 items in Stage 2.3 scope (SYS-010, SYS-011)
- Recommended priority: Complete 2.1 before starting 2.2

---

## Findings

1. **SYS-001** (Agent runtime selection)
   - Status: RESOLVED
   - Decision: Claude Code agents selected as runtime
   - Evidence: Agent definitions created in `00_SYSTEM/AGENTS/`
   - No further action required

2. **SYS-005 to SYS-009** (Agent deployment)
   - Status: Definitions complete, testing in progress
   - Blocking: Stage 2.2 depends on validated agents
   - Current Progress: SYS-005 test complete
   - Priority: P1 (High)

3. **SYS-002 to SYS-004** (Integrations)
   - Status: Pending Stage 2.1 completion
   - Sequence: Gmail → SharePoint → Word
   - Dependencies: Write-back policy, validated agents
   - Priority: P1 (after 2.1 DoD met)

4. **SYS-010, SYS-011** (Validation)
   - Status: Pending 2.1 and 2.2 completion
   - Dependencies: All agents + all integrations
   - Priority: P2

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Focus**: Complete Stage 2.1 agent testing
   - Test fixtures ready in `03_TESTS/fixtures/`
   - Each agent should produce at least one compliant output
   - Safety rails script should pass all checks

2. **Sequencing**: Do not start Stage 2.2 until Stage 2.1 DoD met
   - Agent runtime must be validated
   - Documentation must be complete
   - All test outputs must follow standard format

3. **Stage Closure**: Prepare Stage 2.1 closure checklist
   - Reference DoD in STAGE2_AUTHORIZATION_KICKOFF.md
   - Verify all phases 0.1-4.2 complete
   - Confirm safety rails passing

---

## Actions

- [ ] Complete agent tests (SYS-006 to SYS-009)
- [ ] Create deployment guide (Phase 4.1)
- [ ] Document credential handling (Phase 4.2)
- [ ] Prepare Stage 2.1 closure recommendation
- [ ] Update backlog status for completed items

---

## Evidence

- 04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/BACKLOG.md — Current backlog source
- 04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2_AUTHORIZATION_KICKOFF.md:94-102 — DoD criteria
- 04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2.1/STAGE2.1_ACTION_PLAN.md — Execution tracking
- 00_SYSTEM/AGENTS/ — Agent definitions (5 files present)
- 03_TESTS/agent_outputs/SYS-005_TEST_OUTPUT.md — Completed test output

---

## Assumptions / Confidence

- High confidence: Backlog items correctly enumerated from source
- High confidence: Dependencies correctly mapped between stages
- High confidence: Sequencing logic (2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3) is correct
- Assumed: Stage 2.1 DoD criteria are authoritative and complete
- Assumed: No external blockers affecting schedule

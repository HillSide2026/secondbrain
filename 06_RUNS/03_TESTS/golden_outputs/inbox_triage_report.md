# INBOX Triage Report

**Agent:** SYS-008 — Knowledge Curation
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Scope:** Test Fixtures Review (FIXTURE-001, FIXTURE-002)

---

## Summary

- Reviewed 2 test fixture artifacts
- 1 misplaced artifact identified
- 1 stale artifact identified (>90 days)
- 0 items ready for immediate promotion
- 2 items require remediation before promotion

---

## Findings

1. **FIXTURE-001: Misplaced Artifact**
   - Current: Simulated in `04_INITIATIVES/`
   - Proposed: `01_DOCTRINE/01_BINDING/`
   - Rationale: Contains binding policy language
   - Age: N/A (placement issue, not staleness)
   - Action: Propose move to correct folder

2. **FIXTURE-002: Stale Artifact**
   - Location: Valid
   - Last Updated: 2025-09-29 (simulated)
   - Age: 120 days
   - Threshold: 90 days
   - Action: Propose staleness review

---

## Recommendations

1. **Misplaced Artifact**
   - Do NOT move directly
   - Submit promotion proposal to SYS-005
   - Include:
     - Current path
     - Proposed path
     - Rationale (doctrine content)

2. **Stale Artifact**
   - Flag for content review
   - Options:
     - Refresh content (if still relevant)
     - Archive (if superseded)
     - Delete (ML1 approval required)

---

## Actions

- [ ] Create promotion proposal for misplaced artifact
- [ ] Submit to SYS-005 for governance validation
- [ ] Flag stale artifact for ML1 review
- [ ] Update index after resolution

---

## Evidence

- 03_TESTS/fixtures/misplaced_artifact.md — Contains "BINDING" policy language
- 03_TESTS/fixtures/stale_artifact.md — Simulated last_updated: 2025-09-29
- 00_SYSTEM/FOLDER_MAP.md — Folder placement rules

---

## Assumptions / Confidence

- Using test fixtures (not actual INBOX contents)
- Staleness calculation based on simulated date
- High confidence on misplacement detection
- High confidence on staleness threshold (90 days)
- Promotion requires governance validation (per Write-Back Policy)

# Stage 2.8 Governance Compliance Report

**Agent:** SYS-005 — System Governance
**Version:** v1.0
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Scope:** Artifact compliance review (structure, schema, doctrine)
**Artifact:** `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2.8/STAGE2.8_ACTION_PLAN.md`

---

## Summary

- Reviewed 1 artifact for placement, schema, and doctrine compliance
- Folder placement: **PASS** (initiative roadmap location is correct)
- Schema compliance: **FAIL** (missing required YAML frontmatter)
- Doctrine alignment: **PASS** (no binding policy conflicts detected)
- Escalation required: No (clear remediation path)

---

## Findings

1. **STAGE2.8_ACTION_PLAN.md** — Missing required YAML frontmatter
   - Severity: High
   - Required fields: `id`, `title`, `owner`, `status`, `created_date`, `last_updated`, `tags`
   - Current file begins with a Markdown header instead of YAML frontmatter

---

## Governance Review Notes

- Change type: Content (stage action plan)
- Placement validation: `04_INITIATIVES/.../01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/` is correct per `00_SYSTEM/FOLDER_MAP.md`
- Schema validation: Missing YAML frontmatter (required for all markdown artifacts)
- Doctrine alignment: No binding doctrine conflicts observed

---

## Compliance Determination

**FAIL** — Artifact is not compliant due to missing required YAML frontmatter.

---

## Recommendations

1. Add YAML frontmatter to `STAGE2.8_ACTION_PLAN.md` using required fields. Example:

```yaml
---
id: STAGE2.8-ACTION-PLAN

title: Stage 2.8 — Stage Audit & Archival
owner: ML1
status: approved
created_date: 2026-01-31
last_updated: 2026-01-31
tags: [stage2, roadmap, audit, archival]
---
```

2. Re-run governance check after remediation.

---

## Actions

- [ ] Add required YAML frontmatter to `STAGE2.8_ACTION_PLAN.md`
- [ ] Re-run SYS-005 governance compliance review

---

## Evidence

- `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/STAGE2/STAGE2.8/STAGE2.8_ACTION_PLAN.md:1` — File starts with `# Stage 2.8 — Stage Audit & Archival` (no YAML frontmatter)
- `00_SYSTEM/SCHEMAS.md` — Requires YAML frontmatter for all markdown artifacts
- `00_SYSTEM/FOLDER_MAP.md` — Confirms initiative placement rules

---

## Sign-Off

**SYS-005 System Governance:** NOT APPROVED
**Date:** 2026-02-08

# Portfolio Planning Report — Stage 2.2 + 2.8–2.13 Review

**Agent:** SYS-006 — Portfolio Planning
**Version:** v1.0
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Scope:** Backlog review + Stage 2.2 DoD review + Stage 2.8–2.13 status + sequencing proposal

---

## Summary

- Reviewed System Portfolio backlog (11 candidate items)
- Stage 2.2 DoD is **not met** (Word/OneDrive integration and compliance outputs outstanding)
- Stage 2.8 is **complete**; Stage 2.9 and Stage 2.10 are **complete** (recorded 2026-02-10)
- Remaining incomplete in Stage 2.8–2.13: Stage 2.2 (Word/OneDrive + compliance), Stage 2.11, Stage 2.12, Stage 2.13
- Sequencing remains: complete Stage 2.2 → issue SYS-005/SYS-009 reports → proceed to Stage 2.3
- Backlog updates: none applied (no completed items to retire)

---

## Findings

1. **Stage 2.2 DoD incomplete**
   - Open items include Word/OneDrive read-only activation, audit logging, no-write-path verification, SYS-005 compliance report, and SYS-009 QA validation
   - Evidence: Stage 2.2 DoD checklist remains unchecked for these items

2. **Stage 2.2 execution status remains in progress**
   - Phases 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 marked complete; Phase 2.2.3 pending

3. **Stage 2.9 and Stage 2.10 complete**
   - Drive integration and ledger migration recorded complete
   - Stage 2.11 dependency on Stage 2.9/2.10 is now cleared

4. **Stage 2.11–2.13 remain backlog**
   - Stage 2.11 requires ML1 approval of agent scope + runbook before start
   - Stage 2.12 requires ML1 approval for Calendar write-back and depends on Stage 2.11
   - Stage 2.13 depends on Stage 2.2 completion and Stage 2.11 readiness

---

## Recommendations

1. **Complete Phase 2.2.3 (Word/OneDrive)**
   - Enable read-only access, confirm no write paths, and generate required reports

2. **Finalize compliance outputs**
   - Obtain SYS-005 governance compliance report and SYS-009 QA validation report for Stage 2.2

3. **Prepare Stage 2.2 closure package**
   - Assemble evidence of DoD completion and request closure review

4. **Initiate Stage 2.11 planning**
   - Confirm ML1 approval of agent scope + runbook, then proceed with definition and cadence artifacts

5. **Maintain sequencing discipline**
   - Defer Stage 2.3 operational validation until Stage 2.2 DoD is fully met

---

## Actions

- [ ] Execute Phase 2.2.3 (Word/OneDrive) steps and produce integration status + compliance report
- [ ] Produce audit logging confirmation for Word/OneDrive integration
- [ ] Produce no-write-path verification for Word/OneDrive integration
- [ ] Run SYS-005 governance compliance review for Stage 2.2 outputs
- [ ] Run SYS-009 QA validation for Stage 2.2 outputs
- [ ] Draft Stage 2.2 closure recommendation
- [ ] Confirm ML1 approval to start Stage 2.11 and create the agent definition + runbook

## Assumptions / Confidence

- High confidence: Stage 2.2 DoD status derived from the action plan and authorization checklist
- High confidence: Backlog dependencies reflect current backlog entries
- Assumed: No untracked completion artifacts exist outside the active roadmap folders

## Proposed Action

- **Action Type:** Mark as Processed (ML2 only)
- **Target Location:** 06_RUNS/EXECUTION/processed/
- **Action Description (plain language):** Create a processing record indicating this message has been classified (with ML1 correction) and reviewed. No Gmail modification. Local record only.

---

## Rationale

- **Why this action is proposed:** Message is a CRM-routed client inquiry. ML1 corrected classification from "System Notification" to "Operations — Inquiries". Creating a processed record establishes the first supervised execution and validates the execution pipeline.

- **Why this action is safe:** Action is entirely local to ML2 (this repository). No external system writes. Gmail remains unmodified.

- **Why this action is reversible:** The processed record file can be deleted to restore pre-execution state.

## Risk & Constraints Check

- **External Write Required?** No
- **User-Facing Impact?** No
- **Data Loss Risk?** No
- **Scope-Compliant with Stage 2.5?** Yes

- **Decision Timestamp:** 2026-01-30
- **Decision Recorded By:** ML1
- **Execution Result:** Success

## Notes

- This is the first supervised execution under Stage 2.5
- Execution validates: proposal schema, approval mechanism, logging, and rollback

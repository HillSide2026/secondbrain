# System Definition

This directory defines how the Second Brain works.
05_MATTERS holds live and historical matter files. It is operational memory, not doctrine.

Anything in this folder governs:
- structure
- schemas
- naming
- decision provenance
- change control

No content outside this folder may contradict rules defined here.

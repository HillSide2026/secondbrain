# System Identity — LL Second Brain (ML2)

## What This Repository Is
This repository is the **Second Brain system-of-record (ML2)** for Matthew Levine and Levine Law.

It contains:
- binding system doctrine
- approved playbooks and templates
- governed structures for initiatives, matters, and execution
- auditable outputs derived from approved artifacts

ML2 exists to preserve, apply, and enforce ML1's decisions consistently over time.

## What This Repository Is Not
This repository is **not**:
- a client matter workspace
- a project scratchpad
- a place for ad hoc notes or drafts
- an execution environment for live legal work

Project- or matter-specific materials belong only in their designated directories and never originate doctrine by default.

## Authority and Control
- **ML1 (Matthew Levine)** is the sole authority for doctrine, structure, and exceptions.
- Changes to doctrine, templates, or system rules require explicit approval.
- Levine Law (LL) consumes only approved outputs generated from this system.

## Change Discipline
- `main` is protected.
- All changes are made via pull request.
- Structural or governance changes are classified as **System / Governance** artifacts.

This file defines the identity boundary of the system.

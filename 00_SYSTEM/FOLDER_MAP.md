# Folder Map — Canonical Structure

This document defines the **canonical directory contract** for the LL Second Brain (ML2).
Numbering reflects lifecycle and authority, not importance.

## 00_SYSTEM
System governance, identity, change control, and structural rules.
Defines how the system itself operates.

## 01_DOCTRINE
Binding principles, rules, and decisions.
Doctrine governs all downstream behavior.

## 02_PLAYBOOKS
Procedural guidance for executing doctrine.
"How we do things" when applying rules in practice.

## 03_TEMPLATES
Reusable artifacts (documents, checklists, forms).
Templates implement playbooks and doctrine.

## 04_INITIATIVES
Long-lived, scoped efforts that apply the system.
May generate insights, but do not create doctrine without promotion.

## 05_MATTERS
Persistent records of work (client or internal).
Consume doctrine, playbooks, and templates.
Matters do not originate system truth.

## 06_RUNS
Concrete execution instances.
Ephemeral or repeatable applications of playbooks or templates.
Always linked to a Matter or Initiative.

## 07_RESEARCH
Exploratory analysis and background materials.
Non-binding unless promoted through formal review.

## 08_REFERENCE
Static reference material and external sources.
No original reasoning.

## 09_INBOX
Intake and staging area for new material.
Nothing here is authoritative until promoted.

## 10_ARCHIVE
Completed, superseded, or retired materials.
Read-only by default.

### Promotion Rule (Summary)
Information flows **upward only by intent**:
INBOX → RESEARCH → DOCTRINE / PLAYBOOKS / TEMPLATES
INITIATIVES / MATTERS → INBOX → review → promotion (if approved)

This map is authoritative.

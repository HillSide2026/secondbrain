# Folder Map

- 00_SYSTEM — How the system works (rules, schemas, governance)
- 01_DOCTRINE — ML1-approved doctrines, principles, policies, standards
- 02_PLAYBOOKS — Repeatable operational workflows
- 03_TEMPLATES — Reusable document templates
- 04_INITIATIVES — Strategic initiatives and projects. Grouped by portfolio (SYSTEM vs LL) based on primary beneficiary.
  - System roadmaps live in 04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/{00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS,01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS}.
- 05_MATTERS — Case-specific, stateful matter records. Each folder represents one distinct matter with its own lifecycle.
- 06_RUNS — Execution runs and operational logs
- 07_REFERENCE — Stable reference material (external law/standards/vendors, internal definitions/models)
- 08_RESEARCH — Working notes, explorations, and non-authoritative analysis
- 09_INBOX — Unprocessed intake (must be triaged)
- 10_ARCHIVE — Deprecated or superseded artifacts (never deleted)

# Solution Scope: Incorporation

---

## Statute / Jurisdiction Options

| Statute | Jurisdiction | Typical Use |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| OBCA | Ontario | Ontario-based operations, Ontario presence |
| CBCA | Federal (Canada) | National operations, name protection across provinces |

---

## Included

- Standard private corporation incorporations under OBCA or CBCA
- Single or multiple founders
- Basic share structures (common / simple preferred)
- Initial director and officer setup
- Named or numbered corporations

---

## Explicitly Excluded

- Regulated industries (banking, insurance, other sector-specific licensing regimes)
- Tax-driven structuring decisions
- Securities law advice
- Bespoke share mechanics (complex conversion, multiple preference stacks) unless approved
- Shareholder agreements beyond standard placeholders
- Non-Canadian jurisdictions
- Public company formation

---

## Mandatory Escalation Triggers

Escalate immediately when:

- Choice of OBCA vs CBCA is outcome-determinative and not clearly client-driven
- Non-standard share classes or conversion mechanics requested
- Foreign shareholders with structural implications
- Regulatory licensing requirements exist
- Requests for tax or securities advice
- Any fact pattern exceeding standard private company assumptions

---

## Boundary Conditions

If the incorporation is part of a larger transaction (e.g., acquisition structure), each applicable solution frame should be consulted independently.

An incorporation that will immediately be followed by a shareholder change should also reference the SHAREHOLDER_CHANGE solution.

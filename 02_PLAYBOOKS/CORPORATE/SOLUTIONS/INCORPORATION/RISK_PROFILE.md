# Risk Profile: Incorporation

---

## Default Risk Posture

Conservative, standard private company assumptions.

---

## Key Failure Surfaces

| Failure | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Improper authorization of initial issuances | Defective share structure |
| Incomplete or inconsistent registers | Audit / due diligence failures |
| Misalignment between Articles and resolutions | Governance uncertainty |
| Wrong statute selected | Structural rework required |

---

## OBCA-Specific Pitfalls

- Failure to comply with OBCA filing requirements
- Incorrect director residency assumptions (25% Canadian resident requirement)
- Registered office not in Ontario
- Missing initial return filing

---

## CBCA-Specific Pitfalls

- Failure to comply with CBCA filing requirements
- Incorrect director residency assumptions (25% Canadian resident requirement)
- Annual return requirements differ from provincial
- Registered office requirements

---

## Non-Obvious Risks

| Risk | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Early structural decisions constraining future financings | Simple structure may not accommodate later investment |
| Informal founder expectations not reflected in documents | Disputes when assumptions diverge |
| Share structure too simple for anticipated growth | Rework required at next round |
| No consideration of unanimous shareholder agreement | Control assumptions may be wrong |

---

## Process Risks

- Name search expiring before filing
- Directors appointed before shares issued
- Signing authority unclear at formation
- Corporate existence assumed before certificate received

---

## Escalation Principle

When facts exceed standard assumptions, escalate rather than adapt silently.

Adaptation without escalation creates hidden risk that surfaces later.

# Solution Scope: Shareholder Change

---

## Applicable When

- New shareholders are introduced
- Existing shareholders exit (full or partial)
- Existing shareholders dilute
- Economic rights are reallocated
- Voting or control rights are reallocated
- Share classes are created, modified, or collapsed
- Conversion or exchange rights are exercised

---

## Explicitly Not Applicable When

- Pure incorporations with no equity change
- Internal administrative updates only (e.g., address changes)
- Dividend declarations without structural change
- Officer/director changes without equity implications
- Ordinary course redemptions under pre-existing mandatory terms

---

## Boundary Conditions

If the transaction includes elements of multiple solutions, each applicable solution frame should be consulted independently.

A shareholder change embedded within a business acquisition is still subject to this frame for the shareholder-specific elements.

---

## Jurisdiction Notes

This frame is jurisdiction-agnostic at the conceptual level.

Specific regulatory surfaces (RS-*) are jurisdiction-bound and referenced in the assembly logic.

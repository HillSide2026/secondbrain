# Corporate Solutions

Solution frames for corporate law problem spaces.

---

## What is a Solution Frame?

A solution is **not** a guide, template, or procedure.

A solution frame encodes **expert knowledge about a problem space**:
- When it applies (and when it doesn't)
- What components typically assemble into it
- What artifacts are commonly evaluated
- What risks surface frequently

This is expertise without advice.

---

## Solution Frame Structure

Each solution directory contains:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | What this solution is (and isn't) |
| `SOLUTION_SCOPE.md` | When this solution is relevant |
| `SOLUTION_ASSEMBLY.md` | How the solution draws from other playbook components |
| `COMMON_ARTIFACTS.md` | Categories of documents typically evaluated |
| `RISK_PROFILE.md` | Solution-specific failure modes |

---

## Assembly Logic

Solutions are built by connecting:

- **Issue Maps** — Structured issue taxonomies (IM-*)
- **Decision Lenses** — Analytical frameworks (DL-*)
- **Regulatory Surfaces** — Filing and compliance touchpoints (RS-*)
- **Question Banks** — Discovery and scoping questions (QB-*)

The solution frame specifies *which* components are typically relevant, not *how* to use them.

---

## Disclaimers (Present in Every Solution)

- This is not legal advice
- This does not prescribe a specific transaction structure
- Final judgment remains with ML1
- Presence of an artifact does not imply necessity
- Absence does not imply defect

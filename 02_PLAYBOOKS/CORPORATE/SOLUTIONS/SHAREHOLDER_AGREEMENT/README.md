# Shareholder Agreement

This solution frame applies to two related but distinct agreement types:

| Type | Abbreviation | Key Characteristic |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| Shareholder Agreement | SA | Contractual; directors retain statutory powers |
| Unanimous Shareholder Agreement | USA | Statutory; restricts/transfers directors' powers |

---

## What This Solution Is

- A bounded solution frame for preparing either an SA or a USA
- A structured reference for assembling standard agreement components based on the selected agreement type
- A repeatable pattern aligned with Ontario / Canadian private company norms

---

## What This Solution Is Not

- Not a negotiation or leverage playbook
- Not bespoke tax, estate, or securities advice
- Not suitable for highly customized venture, PE, or control-shifting structures without escalation

---

## Canonical Use Cases

**Shareholder Agreement (SA)**
> Shareholders want contractual governance, transfer, and exit rules while retaining a conventional board.

**Unanimous Shareholder Agreement (USA)**
> Shareholders intend to restrict or eliminate directors' powers and accept corresponding statutory consequences.

## Critical Distinction

| Dimension | SA | USA |
|-----------|----|----|
| Directors' powers | Retained | Restricted or transferred |
| Shareholder liability | None (contract only) | Assumes director-level duties |
| Statutory basis | Contract law | OBCA s.108 / CBCA s.146 |
| Compliance burden | Lower | Higher |

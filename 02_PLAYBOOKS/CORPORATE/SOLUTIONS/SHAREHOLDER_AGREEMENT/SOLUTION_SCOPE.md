# Solution Scope: Shareholder Agreement

---

## Statute / Jurisdiction Options

| Statute | Jurisdiction |
|---------|--------------|
| OBCA | Ontario |
| CBCA | Federal (Canada) |

---

## Agreement Type (Required Selection)

| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Shareholder Agreement (SA)** | Contract among shareholders; board retains powers |
| **Unanimous Shareholder Agreement (USA)** | Statutory agreement; restricts/transfers directors' powers |

This selection is mandatory. Ambiguity between SA and USA is an escalation trigger.

---

## Included

- Private corporation shareholder arrangements
- Founder, family, or closely held companies
- Standard governance, transfer, and exit provisions
- Two or more shareholders

---

## SA-Specific Characteristics

- Directors retain statutory management powers
- Agreement operates purely as a contract among shareholders
- No statutory liability shift
- Enforcement is contractual (breach of contract)

---

## USA-Specific Characteristics

- Directors' powers are restricted or transferred to shareholders
- Shareholders assume director-like liabilities to extent of transferred powers
- Statutory compliance is mandatory (OBCA s.108 / CBCA s.146)
- Must be unanimous (all shareholders, all shares)
- Noted on share certificates

---

## Explicitly Excluded

- Public company or reporting issuer agreements
- Venture capital / institutional bespoke instruments
- Tax-driven reorganizations or estate freezes
- Securities-law-driven governance structures
- Hybrid structures that blur SA/USA distinction

---

## Mandatory Escalation Triggers

Escalate immediately when:

- Any uncertainty about SA vs USA classification
- Partial or ambiguous restriction of directors' powers
- Mismatch between Articles, resolutions, and USA terms
- Client intent to shift liability without understanding consequences
- Non-unanimous shareholder participation in what purports to be a USA
- Complex governance that doesn't fit standard SA or USA patterns

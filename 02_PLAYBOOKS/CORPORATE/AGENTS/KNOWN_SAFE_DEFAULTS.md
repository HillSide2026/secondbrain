# Known-Safe Defaults

Default positions the Agent may apply without escalation when:
- Confidence is HIGH
- No red flags exist
- Facts do not deviate from standard assumptions

---

## Purpose

Codify recurring choices so the Agent acts consistently like an experienced lawyer. These defaults represent firm strategy and market norms for standard private company matters.

Defaults are rebuttable — they apply unless facts indicate otherwise.

---

## Incorporation Defaults

| Decision | Default | Conditions |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Statute | OBCA | Ontario operations, no multi-provincial needs |
| Corporation type | Numbered | Unless client requests named |
| Share structure | Single class common | No investor, no preference needs |
| Initial directors | Founders | Unless separate management indicated |
| Director residency | 25% Canadian | Statutory minimum |
| Registered office | Client business address | Ontario address required for OBCA |
| Fiscal year end | Dec 31 | Unless client specifies otherwise |

---

## Shareholder Agreement Defaults

| Decision | Default | Conditions |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Agreement type | SA | Unless explicit intent to restrict directors |
| Governance | Board-centric | Directors manage; shareholders own |
| Transfer restrictions | Consent + ROFR | Standard private company |
| Exit mechanisms | Tag-along + drag-along | Protect minority; enable majority sale |
| Deadlock (2 shareholders) | Shotgun or mediation | Include mechanism |
| Deadlock (3+ shareholders) | Mediation → arbitration | No shotgun for multi-party |
| Non-compete | Reasonable scope | If shareholders are operators |
| Confidentiality | Standard mutual | Always include |

---

## USA-Specific Defaults (if USA selected)

| Decision | Default | Conditions |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Power transfer scope | Specified powers only | Never blanket transfer |
| Liability acknowledgement | Required | Shareholders must acknowledge |
| Certificate notation | Required | Statutory compliance |
| Board role | Advisory or eliminated | Consistent with USA intent |

---

## OBCA vs CBCA Defaults

| Scenario | Default Statute |
|----------|-----------------|
| Ontario operations only | OBCA |
| Multi-provincial operations | CBCA |
| National name protection needed | CBCA |
| Foreign parent | CBCA (often) |
| Director residency issues | CBCA (may have flexibility) |

---

## Share Structure Defaults

| Scenario | Default Structure |
|----------|-------------------|
| Single founder | 100 common shares |
| Multiple founders (equal) | Equal common shares |
| Multiple founders (unequal) | Pro-rata common shares |
| Angel investment anticipated | Common + simple preferred authorized |
| Employee equity anticipated | Option pool authorized |

---

## Governance Defaults

| Scenario | Default |
|----------|---------|
| Two equal shareholders | 50/50 with deadlock mechanism |
| Majority/minority split | Majority controls board; minority protections |
| Passive investors | Board manages; investor consent on major decisions |
| Active operators | Board seats reflect operational roles |

---

## Artifact Defaults

| Situation | Default Artifacts |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Simple incorporation | Articles, org resolutions, registers, minute book |
| SA with transfer restrictions | SA, transfer notice forms, valuation schedule |
| USA | USA, power transfer schedule, certificate notation form |

---

## When Defaults Do NOT Apply

Defaults are displaced when any of the following exist:

- Client expresses contrary preference
- Facts indicate non-standard situation
- Regulatory overlay exists
- Tax structuring is involved
- Institutional investor is party
- Bespoke share mechanics requested
- Any escalation trigger is hit

When in doubt, ask — do not assume default applies.

---

## Updating Defaults

Defaults may be updated when:
1. Market practice shifts
2. Firm strategy changes
3. Repeated escalations suggest default is wrong

Updates require ML1 approval.

# Contract Playbook Agents

Agent role specifications and supporting references for the Contracts practice area.

---

## Purpose

Define agent roles that operate within the Contracts Playbooks system. Specifications describe:
- What the agent does (expertise + constraints)
- How it produces outputs (schema + confidence)
- How it makes decisions (registry + defaults)
- When it escalates (triggers + gates)

# Known-Safe Defaults — Contracts

Default positions the Agent may apply without escalation when:
- Confidence is HIGH
- No red flags exist
- Facts do not deviate from standard assumptions

Defaults are rebuttable — they apply unless facts indicate otherwise.

## When Defaults Do NOT Apply

Defaults are displaced when:
- Client expresses contrary preference
- Counterparty is institutional or sophisticated
- Contract value exceeds standard thresholds
- Regulatory overlay exists
- Cross-border elements present
- Any escalation trigger is hit

When in doubt, ask — do not assume default applies.

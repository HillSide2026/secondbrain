# Contract Regulatory Surfaces

Statutory and regulatory touchpoints for contract matters.

---

## Purpose

Identify where contracts intersect with regulatory requirements. Not legal analysis — pattern recognition for compliance awareness.

---

## Planned Regulatory Surfaces

| ID | Name | Domain |
|----|------|--------|
| RS-ESA-01 | Employment Standards Act | Employment/contractor contracts |
| RS-CPA-01 | Consumer Protection Act | Consumer-facing contracts |
| RS-PIPEDA-01 | Privacy Legislation | Data handling provisions |
| RS-COMP-01 | Competition Act | Restrictive covenants, non-competes |
| RS-EFTA-01 | Electronic Commerce | E-signatures, electronic contracting |

## Open Question

Whether REGULATORY_SURFACES should be shared across practice areas (global) or maintained per practice area is TBD. Currently duplicated for independence.

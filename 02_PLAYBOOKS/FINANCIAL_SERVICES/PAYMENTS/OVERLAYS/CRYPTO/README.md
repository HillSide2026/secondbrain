# Overlay: CRYPTO

Shared module for crypto-specific regulatory and compliance considerations. Invoked by solutions when crypto assets or virtual currency dealing are involved.

This is an overlay label, not a solution. It layers additional regulatory surface considerations onto whichever solution is primary.

## Placeholder Sections

- Crypto activity types
- Regulatory surface additions
- Safe defaults (placeholders)

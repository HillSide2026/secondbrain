# Overlay: RAILS

Shared module for payment rail classification and rail-specific compliance considerations. Invoked by solutions when rail type affects registration, compliance, or review scope.

This is an overlay, not a solution. It provides rail classification logic as a shared component.

## Placeholder Sections

- Rail types
- Classification criteria
- Safe defaults (placeholders)

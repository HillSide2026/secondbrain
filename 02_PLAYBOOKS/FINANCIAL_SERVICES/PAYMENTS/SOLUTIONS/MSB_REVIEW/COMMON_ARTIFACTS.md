# Common Artifacts: MSB_REVIEW

The MSB Review solution typically produces the following artifacts:

## Core Artifacts

- **MSB Review Memorandum** — Summary of findings, issues, and observations
- **Activity vs. Registration Mapping** — Comparative overview of services and registered categories
- **Change Log** — Identified changes since last registration or review
- **Issue List** — Discrete legal/compliance issues with prioritization
- **Risk Summary** — High-level regulatory risk characterization

## Optional / Contextual Artifacts

- Follow-up question list
- Clarification requests
- Escalation or referral notes
- Scope-boundary statements (what was not reviewed)

## Notes

All artifacts are advisory and diagnostic in nature.

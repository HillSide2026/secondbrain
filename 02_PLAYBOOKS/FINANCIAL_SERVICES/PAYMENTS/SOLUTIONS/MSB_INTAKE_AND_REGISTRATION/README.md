# MSB Intake & Registration — Overview

The MSB Intake & Registration solution provides an integrated legal workstream combining MSB status determination, FINTRAC MSB registration support, and high-level AML/KYC policy drafting, delivered as a single, bounded engagement.

This solution is designed for sub-mid-market businesses that require structured legal assistance to determine whether they are an MSB, complete or regularize registration, and establish an initial policy-level AML/KYC framework—without engaging full-service or ongoing compliance counsel.

## Typical Use Cases

- New or early-stage payments or fintech businesses
- Businesses expanding services or entering Canada
- Legacy businesses uncertain of MSB status or registration accuracy
- Cost-sensitive clients seeking guided registration and baseline documentation

## What This Solution Is Not

- Not ongoing compliance management
- Not operational AML/KYC implementation
- Not a regulatory examination or enforcement response
- Not transaction testing or audit support

## Operating Posture

Containment over completeness; explicit exit states; no assumed ongoing representation.

# Solution Scope: MSB_INTAKE_AND_REGISTRATION

## In Scope

This solution includes legal advisory work relating to:

### 1. MSB Status Intake and Triage

- Review of the client's business activities against MSB categories
- Identification of whether MSB registration is required
- Identification of ambiguity, edge cases, or scope uncertainty
- Documentation of assumptions and classification rationale

### 2. MSB Registration Support

- Organization and structuring of information required for FINTRAC MSB registration
- Review of registration inputs for completeness and internal consistency
- Alignment between described activities and registration categories
- Identification of gaps or inconsistencies requiring clarification

### 3. AML / KYC Policy Drafting

- Drafting of high-level AML/KYC policy documents appropriate to the client's MSB activities
- Policies drafted for initial compliance framework articulation, not operational execution
- Policy drafting aligned to the client's stated business model and registration posture

## Out of Scope

Unless expressly agreed in writing, this solution does not include:

- Implementing AML/KYC policies or procedures
- Drafting detailed operational procedures, workflows, or controls
- Acting as the client's compliance officer or designated responsible person
- Ongoing compliance monitoring, testing, or oversight
- Responding to FINTRAC examinations, inquiries, or enforcement actions
- Filing submissions on behalf of the client where legal representation is required
- Transaction testing, customer file review, or data-level analysis

## Terminal States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Exit | Intake, registration support, and policy drafting complete; deliverables provided |
| Referral | Matter requires MSB_REVIEW, FINTRAC_RESPONSE, or specialized compliance counsel |
| Self-serve | Client proceeds with registration filing and policy implementation independently |

## Escalation Hooks

- MSB classification is ambiguous or edge-case
- Regulator engagement is active or imminent
- Business activities implicate multiple or contested MSB categories
- Client activity may require RPAA registration in addition to or instead of MSB

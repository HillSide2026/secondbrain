# Second Brain — Layer 1 Knowledge Repository

This repository is the **Layer 1 system of record** for Matthew Levine’s Second Brain,
focused on Levine Law (2026).

## Purpose
This repository exists to preserve, structure, and govern:
- ML1-approved doctrine
- Derived playbooks and templates
- Research and reference material
- Decision provenance and system rules

It is **file-based, Git-versioned, and auditable by design**.

## Authority Model
- **ML1 (Matthew Levine)** retains final judgment and approval authority
- This repository records and enforces those decisions
- No agent, tool, or workflow outranks the contents of this repository

## Structure
All structure, schemas, and governance rules are defined in `/00_SYSTEM`.
No content outside `/00_SYSTEM` may contradict it.

## What This Repository Is Not
- Not an execution environment
- Not an agent runtime
- Not a scratchpad
- Not a place for unapproved policy

Execution systems may read from or write to this repository
*only* according to its rules.

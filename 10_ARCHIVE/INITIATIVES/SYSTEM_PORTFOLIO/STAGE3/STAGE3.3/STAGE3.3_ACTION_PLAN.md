## Stage 3.3 Core Question

> Can the system reduce omission risk without injecting judgment or priority?

**Stage 3.3 succeeds if lists feel optional and ignoring items feels safe.**
Its job is to surface, not to direct.

---

## 1. Scope Definition

### In-Scope (Lists Only)

| Output Class | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Points to cover | Reduce forgetting |
| Questions to answer | Surface gaps |
| Risks to flag | Awareness without assessment |
| Follow-ups | Track loose ends |
| Likely misunderstandings | Anticipate recipient confusion |

### Out-of-Scope

| Element | Why Excluded |
|---------|--------------|
| Prioritization | Implies judgment |
| Recommendations | Creates authority |
| Narrative framing | Shapes interpretation |
| Conclusions | Substitutes for ML1 thinking |
| Likelihood assessments | Professional opinion territory |
| Prose paragraphs | Violates list-only rule |

---

## 2. Agents Introduced

### Agent 1: Issue Spotter

**Function:** Surface potential issues from context
**Output:** Risks to flag (list only)
**Ceiling:** No advice, conclusions, likelihood, or severity

See: `02_PLAYBOOKS/STAGE3/ISSUE_SPOTTER.md`

### Agent 2: Communication Coverage Assistant

**Function:** Help avoid omission in communications
**Output:** Points to cover, Questions to answer, Likely misunderstandings
**Ceiling:** Lists only, no phrasing, no prioritization

### Agent 3: Corporate Law Issue Spotter

**Output:** Risks to flag (issue-spotting only)
**Ceiling:** No legal advice, no conclusions, no likelihood

**Critical Framing:** "Have you considered X?" not "X is an issue."

See: `02_PLAYBOOKS/STAGE3/CORPORATE_LAW_ISSUE_SPOTTER.md`

- [x] Never enter Stage 2 queues
- [x] Remain ephemeral by default
- [x] Be flat lists only (no sub-analysis)

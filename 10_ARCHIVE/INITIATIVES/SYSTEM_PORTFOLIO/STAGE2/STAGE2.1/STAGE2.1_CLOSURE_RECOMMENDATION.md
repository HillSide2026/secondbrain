## Constraints Compliance

- [x] No live integration activation (read-only specs only)
- [x] No credential creation or use (template only)
- [x] No external writes (local-first policy enforced)
- [x] No doctrine modifications (agents cannot modify doctrine)
- [x] Agent authority boundaries respected

---

## Recommendation

**APPROVE CLOSURE** — Stage 2.1 is complete. All agents are operational and ready for use in Stage 2.2 (Integration Activation).

---

## Next Stage

**Stage 2.2: Integration Activation**
- Activate Gmail read-only integration
- Activate SharePoint read-only integration
- Activate Word read-only integration
- Agents will support integration validation

---

## ML1 Sign-Off

- [x] ML1 approves Stage 2.1 closure
- [x] All 5 agents promoted to Active status
- [x] Stage 2.2 may be initiated

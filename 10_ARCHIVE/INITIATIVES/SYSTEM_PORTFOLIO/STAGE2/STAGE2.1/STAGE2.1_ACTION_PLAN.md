# Stage 2.1 — Agent Runtime Setup: Action Plan (Amended v2)

## Overview
Deploy 5 system-level agents using Claude Code as the runtime.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-01-31 — status corrected per Stage 2.8 audit)
**Owner:** ML1 + Runbook & QA Agent
**Target:** All 5 agents operational and tested

---

## Prerequisites

### Decisions Resolved ✅
- [x] Runtime: Claude Code agents
- [x] Credential storage: Environment variables (`.env`)
- [x] Integration order: Gmail → SharePoint → Word

### Dependencies
- Stage 1.3 Agent Roster: `01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/STAGE1/STAGE1.3/STAGE1.3_AGENT_ROSTER.md`
- Stage 1.3 Runbooks: `01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/STAGE1/STAGE1.3/STAGE1.3_RUNBOOK_*.md`
- Stage 1.3 Handoff Map: `01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/STAGE1/STAGE1.3/STAGE1.3_HANDOFF_MAP.md`

---

## Action Items

### Phase 0: Repo Structure & Safety Rails (NEW)

#### 0.1 Normalize stage folder naming
- [ ] Rename stage folders to 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4 format

**Deliverable:** Stage folder structure normalized

#### 0.2 Add repo safety rails (NEW)
- [ ] Add lightweight checks (script or pre-commit) to validate:
  - `.env` is not tracked/committed
  - agent outputs only written to allowed folders (per agent contract)
  - required frontmatter/required sections present for designated artifact types

**Deliverable:** Repo safety rail checks committed and runnable locally

---

### Phase 1: Environment Setup

#### 1.1 Create credential infrastructure
- [ ] **Create `.env.example` template** — Document required variables (no secrets)
- [ ] **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`** — Ensure secrets never committed
- [ ] **Create local `.env` file** — ML1 populates with actual credentials
- [ ] **Document credential locations** — Where each credential comes from

**Deliverable:** `.env.example` file with comments explaining each variable

#### 1.2 Create agent configuration directory (AMENDED)
- [ ] **Create `00_SYSTEM/AGENTS/` directory** — Canonical home for agent definitions
- [ ] **Create agent definition templates** — One per agent, based on runbooks
- [ ] **Document invocation patterns** — How to call each agent
- [ ] **Add per-agent contract sections (NEW)** — Inputs/Outputs/Permissions/Prohibitions/Refusals

**Deliverable:** Agent definition files in `00_SYSTEM/AGENTS/`

---

### Phase 2: Agent Deployment

#### Required Agent Definition Schema (NEW)

Each agent definition file MUST include:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agent Identifier** | e.g., SYS-005 |
| **Version** | e.g., v0.1 |
| **Derived From** | runbook path(s) |
| **Authority Scope** | Read permissions, Write permissions (explicit allowlist), Explicit prohibitions |
| **Inputs** | required files/paths/parameters |
| **Outputs** | artifact types + required structure |
| **Invocation Pattern** | example commands/usage |
| **Refusal Conditions** | when to stop/escalate |

#### Standard Agent Output Format (NEW)

All agent-produced artifacts/reports MUST use this structure:

```markdown
## Summary
- (3–5 bullets)

## Findings
1. ...
2. ...

## Recommendations
1. ...
2. ...

## Actions
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...

## Evidence
- file_path:line_number
- ...

## Assumptions / Confidence
- ...
```

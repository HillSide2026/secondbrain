# Stage 2.7 — Matter Brief Structure

## Status

- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Owner:** ML1
- **Effective Start:** 2026-01-31
- **Closed:** 2026-01-31
- **Authority Gate:** Structure deployed, content population is ongoing

---

## Stage 2.7 Core Question

> Can we create a consistent, lightweight structure for capturing matter context without creating busywork?

**Stage 2.7 succeeds if the structure makes it easy to add context incrementally, without feeling like a burden.**

---

## 1. Scope Definition

### In-Scope

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| MATTER_BRIEF.md | One-page overview of matter context |
| FACTS_TIMELINE.md | Chronological event log with sources |
| ISSUES_AND_POSITIONS.md | Issue inventory + ML1 position placeholders |

### Out-of-Scope

| Element | Why Excluded |
|---------|--------------|
| Substantive content | Content population is ongoing, not part of structure rollout |
| Automation | No auto-population; templates only |
| Clio sync | Data remains separate (per field model) |

---

## 2. Templates Created

### MATTER_BRIEF.md

**Purpose:** Single-page matter overview for quick orientation

**Sections:**
- One-paragraph gist
- Parties (Client, Counterparties, Key contacts)
- What's happened so far
- Current posture
- Near-term milestones
- Open questions
- Change log

### FACTS_TIMELINE.md

**Purpose:** Chronological event log with source attribution

**Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD — Event description (source: path or reference)`

### ISSUES_AND_POSITIONS.md

**Purpose:** Issue inventory with ML1 position placeholders

**Sections:**
- Issues (bulleted list)
- ML1 positions (with `[INSERT: ML1 position]` placeholders)

## Pilot Results Summary

- **Total Processed:** 100 messages
- **Classification Rate:** 100% (target: ≥90%)
- **Needs Human Review:** 0
- **Errors:** 0
- **No forbidden operations detected**

### Distribution
- **Object Types:** Legal Matter (46%), Client Communication (42%), System Notification (8%), Vendor/Billing (3%), Marketing (1%)
- **Lifecycle States:** Action Required (59%), Reference (31%), Waiting (10%)
- **System Domains:** Matters (88%), System Operations (8%), Finance (3%), Personal Noise (1%)

---

## Observations

1. **High Matters concentration (88%)** — Expected for legal practice inbox
2. **97% medium confidence** — Classifier is conservative; rules could be tuned
3. **No "Noise" classification** — May indicate pattern gaps or clean inbox
4. **No "Archive Candidate" state** — May need rule refinement

---

## Recommendation

**CLOSE Stage 2.3** — All requirements met.

The Inbox Intelligence Layer is operational and ready for:
- Continuous use (run_pilot.py can be re-run on new messages)
- Integration into future automation stages
- Rule refinement based on ML1 review of classifications

---

## Sign-Off Required

- [ ] **ML1 Approval:** _________________ Date: _________

---

## Post-Closure Actions

1. Archive Stage 2.3 action plan (mark CLOSED)
2. Scope Stage 2.4 (see recommendations below)
3. Consider periodic re-runs to classify new messages

---

## Stage 2.4 Scoping Recommendations

Potential Stage 2.4 focus areas:

1. **Resume Stage 2.2** — Complete SharePoint + Word/OneDrive integrations
2. **Classification refinement** — Tune rules based on pilot learnings
3. **Operational validation** — First complete operating cycle
4. **Action execution layer** — Move from proposals to (supervised) execution

Recommend ML1 decision on Stage 2.4 scope before proceeding.

# Stage 2.3 — Inbox Intelligence Layer: Action Plan

## Status

- **Status:** COMPLETE ✅
- **Owner:** ML1
- **Execution Owners:** SYS-008 (Knowledge Curation) + SYS-005 (Governance) + SYS-009 (QA)
- **Precondition:** Phase 2.2.1 Gmail complete (read-only, audited, no-write)
- **Completed:** 2026-01-29

---

## Purpose

Build a deterministic, auditable inbox triage classifier that:

- reads Gmail messages (read-only),
- produces classification proposals,
- logs every decision,
- generates a Draft Placement Plan artifact for later automation.

**No movement. No external writes. Proposals only.**

---

## Scope

### In scope

- Define taxonomy (object types, lifecycle states, system domains)
- Implement classifier interface (inputs/outputs)
- Create Draft Placement Plan object schema
- Implement classification logging (append-only)
- Run pilot classification on a bounded message set

### Out of scope

- Moving messages, labeling, archiving, replying
- Writing to Gmail, SharePoint, Word, or any external system
- Automated scheduling/polling/background agents
- Matter/client-specific execution workflows

---

## Phase 2.3.1 — Define Triage Taxonomy

**Owner:** ML1 + SYS-008

### 2.3.1.1 Categories (Object Type)

- [ ] Legal matter email
- [ ] Client communication
- [ ] Vendor / billing
- [ ] Marketing
- [ ] System notification
- [ ] Noise

### 2.3.1.2 Lifecycle State

- [ ] Action required
- [ ] Waiting
- [ ] Reference
- [ ] Archive candidate

### 2.3.1.3 System Domain

- [ ] Matters
- [ ] Finance
- [ ] System operations
- [ ] Research
- [ ] Personal noise

### 2.3.1.4 Confidence Policy

- [ ] Define threshold bands (e.g., High / Medium / Low)
- [ ] Define Unknown / Needs human rule
- [ ] Define "minimum evidence" rule for non-Unknown classifications

**Deliverables:**

- `02_PLAYBOOKS/INBOX_TRIAGE/TAXONOMY.md` (taxonomy + confidence rules)

---

## Phase 2.3.2 — Classifier Interface Spec

**Owner:** SYS-008 (draft) + SYS-009 (QA)

### Inputs (read-only)

- [ ] Subject
- [ ] Sender
- [ ] Snippet
- [ ] Labels (read-only)
- [ ] Timestamp
- [ ] Message ID (required)

### Outputs

- [ ] Category (object type)
- [ ] Lifecycle state
- [ ] System domain
- [ ] Confidence (0–1 or banded)
- [ ] Reason trace (short, bounded)
- [ ] Proposed destination root (repo path root only)

**Deliverables:**

- `02_PLAYBOOKS/INBOX_TRIAGE/CLASSIFIER_INTERFACE.md`

---

## Phase 2.3.3 — Draft Placement Plan Schema

**Owner:** SYS-009 (schema draft) + SYS-005 (governance review)

### Draft Placement Plan object (proposal only)

**Required fields:**

- `message_id`
- `classification`
- `lifecycle_state`
- `system_domain`
- `confidence`
- `proposed_destination`
- `status` = `proposal_only`
- `timestamp`
- `model_version` (or ruleset version)

**Deliverables:**

- `00_SYSTEM/SCHEMAS_INBOX_TRIAGE.md`
- `03_TEMPLATES/INBOX_TRIAGE/DRAFT_PLACEMENT_PLAN.json` (example template)

---

## Phase 2.3.4 — Logging Spec and Append-Only Log

**Owner:** SYS-007 (integration boundary check) + SYS-009 (QA)

### Logging requirements

Log every classification decision:

- timestamp
- message id
- predicted class / state / domain
- confidence
- model/ruleset version
- minimal input evidence (subject/sender hash or redacted summary, if needed)

**Deliverables:**

- `02_PLAYBOOKS/INBOX_TRIAGE/LOGGING_SPEC.md`
- Append-only log location (repo-local):
  - `06_RUNS/INBOX_TRIAGE/logs/classification_log.ndjson`

---

## Phase 2.3.5 — Pilot Run (Bounded)

**Owner:** SYS-008
**Validators:** SYS-005 + SYS-009

### Pilot constraints

- [ ] Bounded time window (e.g., last 7 days) OR bounded count (e.g., first 100 messages)
- [ ] No write operations to Gmail (verify allowlist/blocklist)
- [ ] Output proposals only

### Pilot steps

1. [ ] Pull message metadata via Gmail read-only module
2. [ ] Run classifier for each message
3. [ ] Write Draft Placement Plan objects (one per message)
4. [ ] Append to classification log
5. [ ] Produce pilot summary report (counts by class, Unknown rate, confidence distribution)

**Deliverables:**

- `06_RUNS/INBOX_TRIAGE/pilot/YYYY-MM-DD/placement_plans/` (proposal objects)
- `06_RUNS/INBOX_TRIAGE/pilot/YYYY-MM-DD/pilot_summary.md`
- Updated `classification_log.ndjson`

---

## Governance & QA (Required Gates)

### SYS-005 System Governance

- [ ] Confirms no-write-path remains intact
- [ ] Confirms no movement/execution is occurring
- [ ] Confirms artifacts placed in correct directories
- [ ] Issues pass/fail for Phase 2.3 pilot

### SYS-009 Runbook & QA

- [ ] Validates schema compliance for Draft Placement Plan objects
- [ ] Validates report format and required sections
- [ ] Confirms no secrets and no raw credential leakage in logs/reports

---

## QC Review Notes (2026-01-28)

**Reviewer:** Claude (on behalf of ML1)

### Assessment: APPROVED with minor observations

**Strengths:**

1. Clear purpose statement with explicit "No movement. No external writes. Proposals only." constraint
2. Well-structured phases with clear ownership assignments
3. Specific deliverables listed for each phase
4. Governance gates properly defined (SYS-005 and SYS-009)
5. Clear Definition of Done criteria
6. Consistent with read-only doctrine from Stage 2.2
7. Appropriate precondition (Phase 2.2.1 Gmail complete)

**Observations (for ML1 consideration):**

1. **Taxonomy completeness**: Consider whether an "Other/Uncategorized" catch-all is needed for edge cases
2. **Confidence thresholds**: Phase 2.3.1.4 mentions bands but leaves numeric ranges TBD — this is appropriate (ML1 decision)
3. **Pilot scope**: "First 100 messages" vs "last 7 days" — recommend picking one for consistency during actual execution
4. **Schema location**: Phase 2.3.3 offers choice between standalone `SCHEMAS_INBOX_TRIAGE.md` vs appending to existing `SCHEMAS.md` — recommend standalone for modularity

**Structural additions made:**

- Added Execution Tracking tables (consistent with Stage 2.2 format)
- Added References section

**Status:** Ready for Phase 2.3.1 content when provided by ML1.

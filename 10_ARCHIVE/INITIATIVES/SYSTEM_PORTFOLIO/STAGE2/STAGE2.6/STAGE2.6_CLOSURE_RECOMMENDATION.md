# Stage 2.6 — Closure Recommendation

## Status: CLOSED

**Closure Date:** 2026-01-30
**Authorized By:** ML1

---

## Stage Question (Answered)

> "Can ML2 reliably prepare and queue multiple actionable proposals such that ML1 can review, approve, or reject them in batches — without loss of control, trust, or inspectability?"

**Answer:** Yes.

---

## Evidence Summary

### Batch Review Validation

| Batch | Classifier | Approved | Rejected | Accuracy |
|-------|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| BATCH-20260130-001 | v0.2 | 0 | 8 | 20% |
| BATCH-20260130-002 | v0.3 | 9 | 1 | 90% |

**Observation:** Calibration loop working. Accuracy improved 70 percentage points after ML1 feedback incorporated.

## Transition to Stage 3

Stage 2.6 → Stage 3 transition notes:

1. **Stage 2.x remains operational** — Queue, proposals, approvals continue
2. **Stage 3 is a different mental mode** — No proposals, no queue, no execution
3. **Clear separation required** — Stage 3 outputs never enter Stage 2.x systems

---

## Explicit Closure Statement

> Stage 2.6 validated: system can prepare work for ML1 review at scale, with human control preserved.

**No LL-facing execution was authorized during this stage.**

## ML1 Sign-Off

- **Reviewed By:** ML1
- **Closure Date:** 2026-01-30
- **Notes:** Proceeding to Stage 3 (Cognitive & Communication Scaffolding)

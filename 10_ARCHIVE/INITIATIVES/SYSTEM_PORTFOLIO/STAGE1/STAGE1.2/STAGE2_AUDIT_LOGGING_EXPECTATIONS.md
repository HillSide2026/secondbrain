# Stage 2 Audit and Logging Expectations

## Purpose
Define minimum audit/logging expectations for all Stage 2 read-only integrations.

## Required Audit Elements
- Identity (user/system)
- Timestamp
- Resource accessed
- Scope used

## Retention Expectations
- Minimum retention period (to be confirmed).
- Storage location unspecified (documentation only).

## Review Cadence
- Periodic review expectations documented.
- No enforcement or automation implied.

## Constraints
- Dependent on platform-provided logging.
- Tenant policy limitations may apply.

## Open Questions
- Centralized vs system-specific logs?
- Minimum acceptable retention duration?

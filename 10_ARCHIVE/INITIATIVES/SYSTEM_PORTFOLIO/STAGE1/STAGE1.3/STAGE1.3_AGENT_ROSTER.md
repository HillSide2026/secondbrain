## Cross-Agent Rules

1. **No agent can modify doctrine** — doctrine changes require explicit ML1 approval
2. **No agent can approve its own outputs** — cross-agent or ML1 review required
3. **No agent can authorize execution** — execution requires ML1 sign-off
4. **All outputs are proposals** — nothing becomes binding without ML1 approval
5. **Agents reference, not duplicate** — use artifact paths, not copied content

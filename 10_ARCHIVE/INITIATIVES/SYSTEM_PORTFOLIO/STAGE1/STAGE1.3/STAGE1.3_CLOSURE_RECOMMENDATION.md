## Stage 1.3 Definition of Done (DoD) Evaluation

| DoD Requirement | Result | Evidence |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| 5 system-level agents defined with responsibilities + handoffs | PASS | STAGE1.3_AGENT_ROSTER.md defines all 5 agents with roles, inputs, outputs, and constraints |
| Agent governance guardrails documented (no doctrine changes) | PASS | Each agent has explicit authority constraints; cross-agent rules prohibit doctrine modification |
| System runbooks scoped for agent execution flows | PASS | 5 runbooks created (one per agent) with procedures, inputs, outputs |
| Metrics for system reliability + throughput defined | PASS | STAGE1.3_METRICS_AND_CADENCE.md defines 5 metrics with targets and measurement methods |
| Handoff map completed (artifact paths + sequencing) | PASS | STAGE1.3_HANDOFF_MAP.md documents all handoffs, flows, and artifact paths |

## Sequencing Flows

### Flow 1: New Artifact Intake
```
INBOX artifact created
    → Knowledge Curation: index + classify
    → System Governance: validate placement
    → Portfolio Planning: add to backlog (if applicable)
    → ML1: approve promotion (if doctrine/playbook/template)
```

### Flow 2: Stage Closure
```
Stage work complete
    → Runbook & QA: validate deliverables
    → System Governance: compliance check
    → Portfolio Planning: prepare closure package
    → ML1: approve closure
    → Knowledge Curation: archive completed stage
```

### Flow 3: Integration Spec Update
```
Integration requirement change
    → Integration Steward: update spec
    → System Governance: validate no-write-path
    → Runbook & QA: update related runbooks
    → Portfolio Planning: log change in backlog
```

### Flow 4: Compliance Issue
```
System Governance flags issue
    → Knowledge Curation: locate related artifacts
    → Runbook & QA: validate against schema
    → Portfolio Planning: prioritize fix
    → ML1: approve resolution (if doctrine-adjacent)
```

## Artifact Paths by Agent

| Agent | Primary Output Location |
|-------|------------------------|
| System Governance | `06_RUNS/RUN-*/compliance/` |
| Portfolio Planning | `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/BACKLOG.md` |
| Integration Steward | `10_ARCHIVE/INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/STAGE2/` (read), new specs in active stages |
| Knowledge Curation | `00_SYSTEM/`, `07_RESEARCH/`, `09_INBOX/` |
| Runbook & QA | `02_PLAYBOOKS/`, `04_INITIATIVES/.../STAGE*/` |

## Handoff Rules

1. **Explicit artifact paths** — all handoffs reference specific file paths
2. **No implicit state** — handoff triggers are documented events
3. **ML1 gateway** — doctrine/governance changes require ML1 in the flow
4. **Audit trail** — handoffs logged in run logs or commit messages
5. **No circular dependencies** — flows terminate at ML1 or archive

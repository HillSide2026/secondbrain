## Promotion Process

### Step 1: Prepare Package
Portfolio Planning Agent assembles:
- Roadmap document
- Completed promotion checklist
- Summary of ML1 decision points

### Step 2: Governance Review
System Governance Agent validates:
- No doctrine conflicts
- Folder placement correct
- Schema compliance

### Step 3: ML1 Review
ML1 reviews package and:
- Approves → Roadmap moves to `01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/`
- Rejects → Feedback provided, stays in Draft
- Defers → Logged with timeline for re-review

### Step 4: Activation
If approved:
- Move roadmap to `01_ACTIVE_ROADMAPS/`
- Create Stage 1 folder
- Log promotion in DECISION_LOG.md

---

## Demotion Criteria (Active → Draft)

A roadmap may be demoted if:
- ML1 explicitly requests pause
- Blocking dependency discovered post-activation
- Scope change requires re-review

Demotion requires:
- ML1 approval
- Rationale documented
- Move back to `00_DRAFT_ROADMAPS/`

---

## Promotion Rules Summary

1. **ML1 is sole approver** for Draft → Active
2. **Evidence required** — no promotion without checklist
3. **Governance review** — System Governance validates before ML1
4. **Logged** — all promotions recorded in DECISION_LOG.md
5. **Reversible** — demotion possible with ML1 approval

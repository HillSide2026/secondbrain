# Reference

Stable definitions, checklists, and lookups used across the system.

## Authority
- Serves as supporting material; defer to `00_SYSTEM` and `01_DOCTRINE` for governing rules.
- Updated sparingly to preserve continuity for downstream consumers.

## Usage
- Organize entries for quick reuse by playbooks, templates, and research.
- Note source doctrine where applicable and refresh when upstream rules change.
- Favor concise, durable entries over transient notes.

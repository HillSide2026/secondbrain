# Repo-Linter Report - Practice Areas

## Scope
- Root: `02_PLAYBOOKS/`
- Practice-area folders: CONTRACTS, CORPORATE, FINANCIAL_SERVICES

## Summary
- Practice-area folders scanned: 3
- Markdown files missing frontmatter: 0

## Findings
- No schema violations detected within practice-area markdown files.

## Safe Fixes (Draft)
- Add YAML frontmatter to markdown files missing it, per `00_SYSTEM/SCHEMAS.md`.

## ML1 Policy Questions
- Confirm the authoritative list of practice-area folders under `02_PLAYBOOKS/` (current scan excludes `EXECUTION`, `INBOX_TRIAGE`, `MATTER_DASHBOARD`, `STAGE3`).

## Notes
- Anchor validation is based on simple GitHub-style slugging; false positives possible for custom anchors.
- Section checks are string-based and do not validate order or completeness of content.

## ML1 Policy Questions
- Confirm required sections for practice-area agent specs (currently inferred from `00_SYSTEM/AGENTS/PRACTICE_AREA_MASTER_AGENT_SPEC.md`).

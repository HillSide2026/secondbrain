# Second Brain System Model

Type: Interpretive Doctrine  
Status: Draft  
Owner: ML1

## Purpose
This document defines the system model underlying the LL Second Brain (ML2).
It makes explicit the epistemic assumptions, lifecycle model, and points of
intentional divergence from other Second Brain implementations.

This doctrine constrains how judgment, extraction, promotion, and reuse are
understood within the system. It does not create binding rules.

---

## System Model Assumptions

This system is based on a Second Brain model inspired by Iwo Szapar’s knowledge
operations framework.

Key assumptions:
- Information progresses through defined lifecycle stages:
  capture → triage → synthesis → promotion → reuse.
- Separation between raw inputs, interpreted knowledge, and binding decisions
  is intentional.
- Promotion is explicit and governed; extraction alone does not create authority.
- The system prioritizes reuse, traceability, and reversibility over speed.

Execution mechanisms (agents, tooling, integrations) are implementation choices,
not definitional properties of the system.

## Second Brain (Category)

**Second Brain**

A structured, persistent system for augmenting human cognition and
decision-making.

This is the shared category definition. Multiple specifications may exist
within this category.

---

## Specification A — External Second Brain (Iwo Szapar)

**External Second Brain**

A structured, persistent system for augmenting human cognition and
decision-making.

Notes:
- This specification represents the baseline Second Brain model.
- No additional qualifiers are required.
- Emphasis is placed on lifecycle progression, synthesis, and reuse.
- Authority, execution, and write-permissions are implementation-dependent.

---

## Specification B — LL Second Brain (ML2)

**Second Brain (LL Second Brain)**

A structured, persistent system for augmenting human cognition and
decision-making, intentionally implementing a governance-first specification
with stricter authority, execution, and write-permission constraints.

Key characteristics:
- Governance-first design
- Explicit authority boundaries
- Controlled promotion and write-permissions
- Separation between system-of-record (ML2) and execution environments (LL)

This specification intentionally diverges from the baseline model along the
axes of authority, execution, and write-permissions, without implying reduced
capability.

## Relationship to Doctrine and Initiatives

- This model informs the interpretation of doctrine, initiatives, and system
  roadmaps.
- It does not override binding doctrine.
- Changes to this model require explicit review and approval.

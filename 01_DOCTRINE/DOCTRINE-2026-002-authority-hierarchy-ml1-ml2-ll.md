# Authority Hierarchy (ML1 / ML2 / LL)

## Purpose

This doctrine defines the **authority hierarchy** governing:

- ML1 (Matthew Levine)
- ML2 (the Second Brain system)
- LL (Levine Law and its personnel)

Its purpose is to:
- Preserve human judgment and accountability
- Prevent delegation of authority to systems or tools
- Ensure execution environments do not exceed approved scope

This doctrine is binding across the entire Second Brain ecosystem.

---

## The Authority Stack

Authority flows **downward** and never upward.

### 1. ML1 — Human Authority

ML1 (Matthew Levine) is the **sole source of judgment, authority, and accountability**.

ML1:
- Makes all final decisions
- Approves doctrine
- Resolves conflicts
- Grants or withholds permission

Authority **cannot** be delegated away from ML1.

---

### 2. ML2 — System of Record (Second Brain)

ML2 is a **non-autonomous system of record**.

ML2:
- Codifies ML1-approved decisions
- Preserves doctrine, standards, and workflows
- Enforces consistency and structure
- Surfaces conflicts and gaps for ML1 review

ML2:
- Does **not** make decisions
- Does **not** exercise judgment
- Does **not** invent policy
- Does **not** act independently

ML2 exists to **preserve and apply** ML1’s decisions — not replace them.

---

### 3. LL — Execution Environment

LL (Levine Law) is an **execution environment and consumer** of approved outputs.

LL:
- Executes work based on ML1-approved doctrine
- Uses artifacts produced by ML2
- Operates within explicitly defined scope

LL:
- Does **not** create doctrine
- Does **not** modify doctrine
- Does **not** reinterpret doctrine
- Does **not** treat system outputs as authority unless approved

Execution without approval does not create authority.

---

## Prohibited Authority Inversions

The following are explicitly prohibited:

- ML2 making discretionary decisions
- LL interpreting or extending doctrine
- Agents acting as decision-makers
- Repeated usage creating implied authority
- Automation substituting for approval

If an action requires judgment, it requires **ML1**.

---

## Conflict Resolution

In the event of conflict:

1. ML1 decisions override all systems and artifacts
2. Approved doctrine overrides playbooks and templates
3. ML2 flags conflicts but does not resolve them
4. LL must escalate unresolved conflicts to ML1

No system may self-resolve authority conflicts.

---

## Enforcement

Any artifact, workflow, or behavior that violates this hierarchy is invalid.

Violations must be:
- Flagged
- Corrected
- Re-approved if necessary

This doctrine governs all future system design and usage.

---

## Relationship to Other Doctrine

- This doctrine operates **in conjunction with** DOCTRINE-2026-001 (What Qualifies as Doctrine)
- Where ambiguity exists, ML1 judgment prevails

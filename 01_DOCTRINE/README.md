# Doctrine

ML1-approved policies, standards, principles, and rules governing the system.

## Authority
- Authoritative doctrine that inherits structure rules from `00_SYSTEM`.
- Superseding updates move deprecated items to `09_ARCHIVE` with cross-references.

## Usage
- Include YAML frontmatter per `00_SYSTEM/SCHEMAS.md` and track status.
- Cite doctrine IDs when deriving playbooks or templates.
- Submit revisions through change control defined in `00_SYSTEM`.

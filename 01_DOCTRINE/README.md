# Doctrine

Doctrine is the system's authoritative guidance. It is organized by type:

## 01_BINDING
Non-optional rules, definitions, constraints, and required workflows.
If violated, it is a system breach.

## 02_INTERPRETIVE
Clarifications, edge-case guidance, and principles for exercising judgment
when binding doctrine does not uniquely determine an outcome.
Interpretive doctrine does not override binding doctrine.

## 03_PROCEDURAL
Governance and change-control doctrine: how doctrine and system rules are
reviewed, approved, versioned, deprecated, and migrated.

## Classification rule
- "must / required / never / always" → Binding
- "means / applies when / examples / principles" → Interpretive
- "review / approval / version / deprecate / change control" → Procedural

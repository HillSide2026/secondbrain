# Doctrine

This folder contains **ML1-approved doctrine**: policies, standards, principles, and rules.

Rules:
- Doctrine must include YAML frontmatter per `/00_SYSTEM/SCHEMAS.md`
- Status must be `approved` to be treated as authoritative
- Superseded doctrine is moved to `/10_ARCHIVE` and linked via `supersedes`
